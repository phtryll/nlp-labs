"As stated above, Gadolinite was discovered by Arrhenius in 1788. Geijer examined it in the same year, and described it as a black zeolite. In 1794 it was analysed by Gadolin, who declared it to be a silicate of iron, aluminium, and a new element which he called Ytterbium. In 1797 Ekeberg examined it, and confirmed the discovery. He proposed the name Gadolinite for the mineral, and Yttria for the new earth; these names were accepted by Klaproth, who examined it with Vauquelin in 1800, and by the French crystallographer Haüy. In 1802 Ekeberg showed that the oxide originally taken for alumina was in reality beryllia; in 1816 Berzelius showed that ceria was present with the yttria. About 1838 Mosander began his classical work on the earths in gadolinite. In that year he announced the separation of Lanthana, and in 1842 that of Didymia, which he had actually discovered eighteen months earlier. In the latter year he announced the separation of erbia and terbia. In 1842 also Scheerer declared that the yttria from gadolinite was a mixture of earths, from its different behaviour on heating in closed and open vessels; but when Mosander announced the discovery of didymia (the announcement appears to have been hastened indeed by Scheerer’s observation) it was agreed that the colouration observed was probably due to that earth. The further history of these earths must be continued elsewhere (vide p. 111)."
"There is no such thing, at this stage of the world’s history in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who dare write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinions out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my papers, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. The business of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes."
"More than once in history have people revolted against the inequalities of life and refused to submit to the restraints of laws and creeds. They have often gone through a period of communism and red terror in the hope of realizing ultimately the Perfect State. Their leaders, undoubtedly sincere at first, espouse the utopian dream, declaring themselves the exponents of its ideals, the promised messengers of its blessings. But with the material for revolt ready at hand, and unable to resist the seductions of nascent power, they soon undergo that transformation which history identifies, often not unjustly, with demagogy, if they fail, or with autocracy, if they succeed. In either case, by utilizing the elements of negation in Society, they become apostles of violence, proclaiming the theory of ""creative destruction."" But instead of creating a utopia on the ruins of their making, they only succeed in setting up, as history shows, another government, which, no matter how just and sound its foundations are in theory, soon becomes in practice more despotic and corrupt."
"And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America — the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can. At a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach out for the ballot. Yes we can. When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs, a new sense of common purpose. Yes we can. When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved. Yes we can. She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that we shall overcome. Yes we can. A man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination."
"Of all the witches that may be found in all the fairy tales ever told there is none more delightfully sociable than the Sand Witch. This Witch, who lives underneath the heaps of sand at the ocean's edge, where, in the summertime, you dig with your shovel, is not at all like other witches. She never rides on a broomstick, and she never goes down chimneys. In the first place there are no broomsticks or chimneys on the beach at the sea-shore, and in the second place she would not know how to ride on a broomstick or climb down a chimney, if there were. All the Sand Witch knows how to do is to sink into the sand when anything scares her, and to come up through the sand when she sees a chance to get acquainted with a person she never was acquainted with before. So now you know what a Sand Witch is. And if Junior Jenks, seven years old, and dreadfully sunburnt, had known what you know, he would have been much better prepared to face the one that came up right under his nose all of a sudden one hot July morning."
"So we part, I to my country and you to remain. We are – if a man of forty can claim that privilege – fellow members of the world's largest younger generation. Each of us have our own work to do. I know at times you must feel very alone with your problems and difficulties. But I want to say how impressed I am with what you stand for and the effort you are making; and I say this not just for myself, but for men and women everywhere. And I hope you will often take heart from the knowledge that you are joined with fellow young people in every land, they struggling with their problems and you with yours, but all joined in a common purpose; that, like the young people of my own country and of every country I have visited, you are all in many ways more closely united to the brothers of your time than to the older generations of any of these nations; and that you are determined to build a better future."
"Modern-day Laos has its roots in the ancient Lao kingdom of Lan Xang, established in the 14th century under King Fa Ngum. For 300 years Lan Xang had influence reaching into present-day Cambodia and Thailand, as well as over all of what is now Laos. After centuries of gradual decline, Laos came under the domination of Siam (Thailand) from the late 18th century until the late 19th century, when it became part of French Indochina. The Franco-Siamese Treaty of 1907 defined the current Lao border with Thailand. In 1975, the communist Pathet Lao took control of the government, ending a six-century-old monarchy and instituting a strict socialist regime closely aligned to Vietnam. A gradual, limited return to private enterprise and the liberalization of foreign investment laws began in 1988. Laos became a member of ASEAN in 1997 and the WTO in 2013."
"Why, of course, the people don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. [...] Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country."
"Today was also the first day the scientists were able to get in the water. This is my first cruise to the monument and I was beyond excited to hear I would get a few hours to snorkel the maritime archeologist’s field sites. The archeology team and I were launched from one of the Hi’ialakai’s small boats and were soon hovering over a wreck that is thought to be an American whaling ship. It was particularly intriguing as a marine mammal scientist to be able to see large pots used to render oil from the whales, blubber hooks, and other whaling paraphernalia scattered along the reef. Marine mammals played such an important role in the human history of these islands, it is exciting to be able to return to these sites as a scientist and simultaneously learn about whales’ past and present influence on this area."
"The Top 10 Species list is compiled annually by the International Institute for Species Exploration, or IISE. It calls attention to discoveries that are made even as species are going extinct faster than they are identified. From among the 18,000 new species named last year, a committee of taxonomists chose the ones that made the 2015 list. They include a bird-like dinosaur, dubbed the “chicken from Hell,” that was 3.5 meters from beak to tail and weighed as much as 300 kilograms; a spider that lives in the Moroccan desert and can use its gymnastic talents to cartwheel out of danger; a 23-centimeter-long walking stick common in Vietnam; and a colorful sea slug from the Japanese islands that is the missing link between slugs that feed on colonies of tiny stinging jellies and those specializing on corals."
"Only the assumption that the reader - I better say: the prospective reader, because for the moment there is not the slightest prospect, that my writing could see the lights of publicity, - unless it miraculously left our endangered fortress Europe and brought a hint of the secrets of our loneliness to those outside; - I beg to be allowed to begin anew: only because I anticipate the wish to be told casually about the who and what of the writer, I send some few notes on my own individuum out before these openings, - of course not without the awareness that exactly by doing so I might provoke doubts in the reader, that he is in the right hands, which is to say: if I, from all my being, am the right man for a task to which maybe the heart pulls me more than any qualifying relation in character."
"It was a country of wide pastures, of moors covered with heath, of rock-born streams and rivulets, of forest and hill and dale, sparsely inhabited, with the sea to the eastward of it, unseen, and the mountains everywhere visible always, and endlessly changing in aspect. Herdsmen and shepherds wandered over it, and along its almost disused roads pedlars and pack mules passed at times but rarely. Minerals and marbles were under its turf, but none sought for them; pools and lakes slept in it, undisturbed save by millions of water fowl and their pursuers. The ruins of temples and palaces were overgrown by its wild berries and wild flowers. The buffalo browsed where emperors had feasted, and the bittern winged its slow flight over the fields of forgotten battles."
"This Inspector, when I first knew him, was a man of fourscore years, or thereabouts, and certainly one of the most wonderful specimens of winter-green that you would be likely to discover in a lifetime’s search. With his florid cheek, his compact figure, smartly arrayed in a bright-buttoned blue coat, his brisk and vigorous step, and his hale and hearty aspect, altogether he seemed—not young, indeed—but a kind of new contrivance of Mother Nature in the shape of man, whom age and infirmity had no business to touch. His voice and laugh, which perpetually re-echoed through the Custom-House, had nothing of the tremulous quaver and cackle of an old man’s utterance; they came strutting out of his lungs, like the crow of a cock, or the blast of a clarion."
"The last film in the Lord of the Rings series, The Return of the King debuted in mid-December, and is still showing in U.S. movie theaters. The epic trilogy comes to a close with a final battle for Middle Earth, and Frodo's heroic effort to cast the ring into the fiery lava of Mount Doom. The soundtrack features several appearances by renowned Irish flutist James Galway. The high tenor voice of actor Billy Boyd, who plays one of the hobbits, is also highlighted, along with an emotional narrative. To coincide with the film's climax, composer Howard Shore added more operatic elements to the score. The Return of the King also features the song Into The West, written and recorded by former Eurythmics member and Grammy Award-winning singer Annie Lennox."
"On April 17, 1970, Apollo 13 splashes down safely in the Pacific Ocean after the crew and NASA engineers surmounted what seemed like impossible odds in a story that captivated the entire planet. The mission started off well, but when the spacecraft was over 200,000 miles from Earth, an oxygen tank exploded during a routine check, all but crippling the spacecraft. NASA decided the best way back to earth was to slingshot around the moon. During the trip back, the crew of astronauts, James A. Lovell, John L. Swigert and Fred W. Haise, endured freezing temperatures, limited power, shortage of water and toxic levels of carbon dioxide. Many consider the safe return of Apollo 13 one of NASA’s finest moments. The saga was made into a movie in 1995."
"Here, you have translated from the sentence in < the language you have translated from > and you created a link to that one. I think this is the sentence in < the language you want to translate from > that you wanted to translate. To do this, you must first click on the sentence in < the language you want to translate from > before clicking on the translation button. The sentence that you are translating must ALWAYS stand on top of the pile (in the largest typeface) and it is the only one visible at the time you're editing your translation, and that is on purpose to avoid influence on your translation, as in Tatoeba, sentences are linked by twos, not as blocks, since a sentence may have several different translations in the same language!"
"At the molecular level, salt dissolves in water due to electrical charges and due to the fact that both water and salt compounds are polar, with positive and negative charges on opposite sides in the molecule. The bonds in salt compounds are called ionic because they both have an electrical charge—the chloride ion is negatively charged and the sodium ion is positively charged. Likewise, a water molecule is ionic in nature, but the bond is called covalent, with two hydrogen atoms both situating themselves with their positive charge on one side of the oxygen atom, which has a negative charge. When salt is mixed with water, the salt dissolves because the covalent bonds of water are stronger than the ionic bonds in the salt molecules."
"Nothing could well resemble less a typical English street than the interminable avenue, rich in incongruities, through which our two travelers advanced—looking out on each side of them at the comfortable animation of the sidewalks, the high-colored, heterogeneous architecture, the huge white marble facades glittering in the strong, crude light, and bedizened with gilded lettering, the multifarious awnings, banners, and streamers, the extraordinary number of omnibuses, horsecars, and other democratic vehicles, the vendors of cooling fluids, the white trousers and big straw hats of the policemen, the tripping gait of the modish young persons on the pavement, the general brightness, newness, juvenility, both of people and things."
"The life of a young deer can be a tough one. Born barely able to walk, these young deer cannot keep up with their mothers, and they must spend their first weeks of life mostly alone. Fawns will hide from predators throughout the day as the does forage for food to sustain themselves and their babies. The mothers will periodically visit the fawns to nurse, but they also try to keep their young hidden from hunting coyotes and bobcats. Studies of JSC’s deer population show that increased rainfall in the winter and spring results in higher numbers of fawn the following year. In wet years, higher rates of twins, and higher survival rates due to better nutrition, give the deer population the boost it needs to recover from dry years."
"It is true that the passage to which we have referred, and several other passages which we could point out, are admirable when considered merely as exhibitions of mental power. We at once recognise in them that consummate master of the whole art of intellectual gladiatorship, whose speeches, imperfectly as they have been transmitted to us, should be studied day and night by every man who wishes to learn the science of logical defence. We find in several parts of the History of James the Second fine specimens of that which we conceive to have been the great characteristic Demosthenes among the Greeks, and of Fox among the orators of England, reason penetrated, and, if we may venture on the expression, made red-hot by passion."
"Theirs was a nervous household. Jock and Hurry confined indoors for nearly two days had had too little exercise and too many good things to eat. They were quite cross and irrepressible. John had the fidgets. He couldn't even stay in the same room for more than a minute, and he wouldn't even try sitting down for a change. Lucy had had to give up at least a dozen things that required dry weather and sunshine. She seemed to take the rain as something directed particularly against herself by malicious persons. Evelyn, also cross and nervous, was on the point of retiring to her own room to write letters. Just then Dawson Cooper telephoned to know if she cared to take a little walk in the rain and she accepted with alacrity."
"George Frederick Handel, unquestionably the greatest master of music the world has ever known, was born at Halle, in Upper Saxony, on the 24th of February, 1684. Scarcely could he speak, before he articulated musical sounds; and his father, a physician, then upwards of sixty, having destined him for the law, grieved at the child’s propensity to music, banished from his house all musical instruments. But the immortal spark of genius, which Heaven had kindled in the infant’s bosom, was not to be extinguished by the caprice of a mistaken parent. The child contrived to get a little clavichord into a garret; where, applying himself after the family retired to rest, he soon found means to produce both melody and harmony."
"Mr. and Mrs. William Webster had come all the way from Woodford to Concord, leaving three babies at home, to assist their old friends at the Inaugural Ball. You must have guessed that Mollie O'Neill, as Mrs. William Webster, would have grown plumper and prettier during the busy, happy years of married life with her husband and children on their large farm. For Mollie now had a small daughter ""Polly,"" named for her beloved twin sister, and a pair of twin sons, Dan and Billy. She was more than ever in love with her husband and, many people believed, entirely under his thumb. Yet there were times when Mollie could and would assert herself in a surprising fashion just as she had in former days with her girl friends."
"Scientists wanted to see how these developing larvae were being affected by the increased acidity of the ocean water caused by excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Whitman Miller — an environmental scientist and ecologist with the Smithsonian research center — says oceans normally absorb about half of the carbon dioxide that's produced by living creatures. But when excess CO₂ is pumped into the atmosphere and dissolves into seawater, that contributes to an acidification, or a lowering of the pH of the oceans. A byproduct of that process — carbonic acid — rapidly converts to carbonate and bicarbonate ions, which Miller says are corrosive to the calcium carbonate shells of oysters and other marine species."
"In general the physical and mental form of conscious beings is an expression of the character of the planet on which they live. On certain very large and aqueous planets, for instance, we found that civilization had been achieved by marine organisms. On these huge globes no land-dwellers as large as a man could possibly thrive, for gravitation would have nailed them to the ground. But in the water there was no such limitation to bulk. One peculiarity of these big worlds was that, owing to the crushing action of gravitation, there were seldom any great elevations and depressions in their surface. Thus they were usually covered by a shallow ocean, broken here and there by archipelagos of small, low islands."
"The nature of memory has been the subject of considerable speculation in the past. It has long been felt intuitively that retention of information in the central nervous system involves either an alteration of preexisting material or structure, or, alternatively, synthesis of materials not present previously. The cellular site of operational alteration was unknown but, again intuitively, was felt to be closely associated with the synapses. The problems faced by early investigators were great; but nevertheless much information relevant to the question of biological information storage was obtained. With the relatively recent advent of more refined tools and methodologies, there has been rapid progress."
"Yes, another Roosevelt. The Roosevelts have some of the most gorgeous memorials in D.C. This one is dedicated to the 32nd President of the United States, and each of the four terms of his presidency has its own room. With walls covered with some of Roosevelt's most inspirational quotes — ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself"" — and statues of Americans listening to Roosevelt's radio addresses or standing in bread lines, the memorial is a trip through time. If you're in D.C. for longer than a few days, it's also a great place to study. Sit by Roosevelt's statue and watch as people touch his finger for good luck. (And maybe slyly do the same on your way out. Hey, we could all use some luck!)"
"What's surprising is that reducing certain materials from the macro to the nano scale radically changes some of their properties. For example, gold becomes a liquid at room temperatures, aluminum becomes combustible, and silicon turns into a conductor instead of an insulator. So these very small materials behave in ways that are not yet completely understood, and just the fact that they are unimaginably small creates a lot of the controversy. People fear that smaller nanotech particles in the environment might be accidentally absorbed by the human body, that invisible surveillance devices could watch our every move, or that microscopic new weapons would threaten our security in unforeseen ways."
"Vietnam counts itself among the top five countries in the world that would be devastated if global warming gets even more severe, especially with its 3,000 kilometers of coast along the South China Sea. As it works to implement an action plan under the Paris Climate Change Accord, the country is looking for ways to mitigate the environmental toll of the fast-growing construction industry, which consumes a lot of sand for cement, electricity, and other building supplies. The construction and industrial sectors expanded 8.8 percent in 2018 versus the year earlier, higher than the overall economy’s expansion of 7 percent, according to data from the property developer Jones Lang Lasalle Vietnam."
"One of his notable achievements came after he lobbied the government to curtail all forms of discrimination against people with disabilities. The result was a government-endorsed policy called Equalization of Opportunities for People with Disabilities. The policy promotes equal opportunity for persons with disabilities and their full participation in all social, economic, political and cultural activities. As a result, he says the policy has led to an increasing number of people with disabilities being employed in both the public and private sectors. But Chiwaula says the policy, while well meaning, needs reinforcement. This, because there are still some who are ignoring the initiative."
"For example the participants study ways that structures can be planned to save electricity and water, as well as to be “bioclimatic,” which means that they adapt to the surrounding environment. In the northern capital of Hanoi, it is more useful to firm up insulation and conserve heat to keep people warm in the winter. But in contrast in the southern metropolis of Ho Chi Minh City there are just two seasons — rainy and dry — and not much need to heat buildings. Instead designers can consider how to position southern buildings to take advantage of wind tunnels, which bring natural ventilation in the humid climate, or to soak up sun rays to generate the most solar power possible."
"The Americans wanted to impose the idea that a book or film should be treated like any commercial object, because they understood that alongside the army, diplomacy and trade, there is also cultural war, a battle that they intend to win both for noble reasons — the United States has always opined that its values are universal — and less noble ones: the formation of minds is the best way to sell off American products. Consider that the cinema represents the top rank of American exports, far ahead of weaponry, aeronautics or information technology! Hence their desire to impose English as a world language, even if there has been a two-decade decline in their influence."
"According to Stewart, the Chinese also have a special reverence for the number seven. They believe that many stages of their lives are related to that number, he explains. People get their baby teeth when they're seven months old, their adult teeth when they're seven years old, go through puberty when they're 14, which is 2 times 7, women go through menopause when they're 49, which is 7 times 7. Stewart says people find these patterns significant because they suggest, in one sense, a grand plan. Clearly, he notes, these ages aren't exact, women don't always go through menopause at 49, but they're very close approximations. And the number seven keeps coming up."
"This was what she did: she touched with her wand everything in the palace (except the King and Queen),—governesses, maids of honor, ladies of the bedchamber, gentlemen, officers, stewards, cooks, undercooks, kitchen maids, guards with their porters, pages, and footmen; she likewise touched all the horses which were in the stables, the cart horses, the hunters and the saddle horses, the grooms, the great dogs in the outward court, and little Mopsey, too, the Princess's spaniel, which was lying on the bed. As soon as she touched them they all fell asleep, not to awake again until their mistress did, that they might be ready to wait upon her when she wanted them."
"In nineteen-oh-six, she married Charles Joseph Walker. He was a newspaperman who had become her friend and adviser. From then on, Sarah used the name madam C. J. Walker. Madam Walker organized women to sell her hair treatment. She established Walker schools of beauty culture throughout the country to train the saleswomen. The saleswomen became known as ""Walker Agents."" They became popular in black communities throughout the United States. Madam Walker worked hard at her business. She traveled to many American cities to help sell her products. She also traveled to the Caribbean countries of Jamaica, Panama, and Cuba. Her products had become popular there too."
"Fossett successfully made the trip in two thousand two. The trip started and ended in Australia. He travelled more than thirty-three thousand kilometers for more than fourteen days. He only slept about three hours a day. Much of his flight took place at an altitude of more than eight thousand meters, so he had to breathe air from a liquid oxygen system. On this flight, Fossett set other records including a speed record of three hundred twenty-two kilometers per hour. One main problem with earlier balloon flights was the threat of dangerous storms. A team of weather experts e-mailed and talked to Fossett by satellite telephone to help him avoid such weather."
"In every hedge we passed were medlars, plumbs, cherries, and maples with vines trained to them. This abundance of fruit gives an air of great plenty, and likewise much improves the beauty of the country. The French fruit of almost every kind exceeds the English. An exception must be made with respect to apples, which are better in England than in any country in the world. But the grapes, the plumbs, the pears, the peaches, the nectarines, and the cherries of France, have not their equal all the world over. They are of course cheap in proportion to their abundance. The health of the peasantry may perhaps in good part be imputed to this vegetable abundance."
"The exhibit includes a movie about Elvis’ life and the evolution of his representation by the media. There are also several objects from Elvis’ personal life. You can see a large nineteen fifty-seven Harley Davidson motorcycle he once owned. There is a bottle of Champagne from Elvis’ wedding to Priscilla Beaulieu, and clothing worn by his daughter Lisa Marie. And it is hard to miss the jeweled white jumpsuit that Elvis wore for his famous “Aloha from Hawaii” performance. An estimated one billion people in forty countries watched this program when it was broadcast on television in nineteen seventy-three. He died four years later at the age of forty-two."
"For those who have been scarred by the violence that was witnessed. I know exactly what you feel, we have been all through the same experience as people from this nation and we need to share our feelings with each other, however, this does not mean it will hurt less for all of us. Because of this, we need to stay strong and united while we recover from our losses and be reminded that giving up is never an option, and as for me, i need time for myself in the same way, but i assure everyone that regardless of that i will be taking care of the people in need everywhere in the territory with the proper thought and all of my strength. Communication, out."
"Hailstones are formed when raindrops are carried upward by thunderstorm updrafts into extremely cold areas of the atmosphere and freeze. Hailstones then grow by colliding with liquid water drops that freeze onto the hailstone’s surface. If the water freezes instantaneously when colliding with the hailstone, cloudy ice will form as air bubbles will be trapped in the newly formed ice. However, if the water freezes slowly, the air bubbles can escape and the new ice will be clear. The hail falls when the thunderstorm’s updraft can no longer support the weight of the hailstone, which can occur if the stone becomes large enough or the updraft weakens."
"Until several decades ago, the physical sciences were considered to have had their origins in the 17th century—mechanics beginning with men like Galileo Galilei and magnetism with men like the Elizabethan physician and scientist William Gilbert. Historians of science, however, have traced many of the 17th century's concepts of mechanics back into the Middle Ages. Here, Gilbert's explanation of the loadstone and its powers is compared with explanations to be found in the Middle Ages and earlier. From this comparison it appears that Gilbert can best be understood by considering him not so much a herald of the new science as a modifier of the old."
"Food traceability is the ability to follow the movement of a food product and its ingredients through all steps in the supply chain, both backward and forward. Traceability involves documenting and linking the production, processing, and distribution chain of food products and ingredients. In the case of a foodborne illness outbreak or contamination event, efficient product tracing helps government agencies and those who produce and sell food to rapidly find the source of the product and where contamination may have occurred. This enables faster removal of the affected product from the marketplace, reducing incidences of foodborne illnesses."
"In the name of the Brazilian president, Luiz Inacio Lula de Silva, Claudio Soarez Rocha expressed admiration for the continuing effort which Esperanto-speaking people throughout the world are always making, for the greater spread of Esperanto. He wrote, amongst other things,""We know that in the history of mankind, there have been languages that have become intrusive as a result of political power, such as Latin, or to a certain extent French and lately, English. We very much wish, in fact, that one day Esperanto could be accepted by the majority of the nations, as a language adopted to facilitate communication without linguistic privileges."""
Federally regulated financial institutions were generically analyzed to determine their ability to continue to promote essential services in the event of a major earthquake like those that have been postulated for this assessment. The conclusion reached thus far is that large-magnitude earthquakes pose no significant or unanticipated problems of solvency and liquidity for such institutions. The Federal Reserve System and other regulatory entities have procedures in place that are designed—and have been tested—specifically to provide for the continued operation of financial institutions immediately following an earthquake or other emergency.
"When we come to die, we shall be alone. From all our worldly possessions we shall be about to part. Worldly friends — the friends drawn to us by our position, our wealth, or our social qualities, — will leave us as we enter the dark valley. From those bound to us by stronger ties — our kindred, our loved ones, children, brothers, sisters, and from those not less dear to us who have been made our friends because they and we are the friends of the same Saviour, — from them also we must part. Yet not all will leave us. There is One who ""sticketh closer than a brother"" — One who having loved His own which are in the world loves them to the end."
"Filby became pensive. “Clearly,” the Time Traveller proceeded, “any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration. But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.”"
"Stories of shark attacks are unnerving for those who enjoy swimming in the ocean. They deepen the controversy about how close humans should even get to these animals. While defenders of sharks acknowledge they should be treated with a healthy dose of fear, they also say sharks are highly misunderstood. Of over 380 types of sharks, only 3 or 4 kinds are known to attack humans, and there are fewer than 80 such attacks a year. On the other hand, many types of sharks are on the verge of extinction, due to human fishing practices. VOA-TV's Zulima Palacio went diving with a woman who takes divers under water to experience ""swimming with sharks""."
"The village of San José at Himuri is three leagues to the east of San Ignacio. It is bordered on the east and on the north by the mountains. It is blessed with good lands but the Indians work very little or not at all at farming them. The church and house of the Missionary are nearly in ruins. The ornaments for the altar and divine services have dwindled to one chalice, three chasubles, two albs, three amices, and other adornments, all very old and almost unserviceable. According to the Census Book, which I have here before me, there are seven married couples, six widowers, nine orphans, the number of souls in all thirty-nine."
"In this regard, he says, his organization has come out with a draft bill that was sent to the Parliament three years ago. If passed, the bill will protect people with disabilities against all forms of stigmatization and discrimination. Chiwaula also helped lead a successful effort to encourage the media to avoid terms that people with disabilities find offensive, such as “disabled people” and “the blind.” They prefer “people with disabilities,” and “people with visual impairments.” His organization is running awareness campaigns encouraging primary school teachers to integrate children with disabilities in school activities."
"I travelled to multiethnic walkable Singapore on my way to Bali. There, it was a land of four official languages, Mandarin, Malay, Tamil, and English. I liked the food there a lot, including ""cumi-cumi"" or squid served in a clay hotpot. I saw dark Tamil people eating with hands on big banana leaves. Hawkers in Malay shrieked, ""Makan! Makan!"" (Eat! Eat!). Vendors sold big funny-looking lotus flowers. Some men were wearing colourful aloha shirts. My quaint hotel was decorated in 19th-century colonial Sino-British fashion. Later, from the Web, I tried job-hunting in the city-state, because it looked like a comfortable place."
"We sometimes live for three hundred years, but when we cease to exist here, we become only foam on the surface of the water and have not even a grave among those we love. We have not immortal souls, we shall never live again; like the green seaweed when once it has been cut off, we can never flourish more. Human beings, on the contrary, have souls which live forever, even after the body has been turned to dust. They rise up through the clear, pure air, beyond the glittering stars. As we rise out of the water and behold all the land of the earth, so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see."
"Louis Kahn was an artist who created beautiful works. But he was not a very good businessman. He would change his designs many times. This would make each project take a great deal of time and cost more money. The majority of the projects he designed were never built. Also, he did not like to compromise his design ideas to satisfy a buyer’s wishes. For this reason and others, Kahn did not make many buildings. His design company did not always have many jobs or much money. In fact, when Kahn died, he was in great debt. This is especially unusual since he was considered one of the most important architects in the world."
"Research has shown that UV radiation increases the likelihood of certain cataracts. Although curable with modern eye surgery, cataracts diminish the eyesight of millions of Americans and cost billions of dollars in medical care each year. Other kinds of eye damage include pterygium (tissue growth that can block vision), skin cancer around the eyes, and degeneration of the macula (the part of the retina where visual perception is most acute). All of these problems can be lessened with proper eye protection. Look for sunglasses, glasses or contact lenses if you wear them, that offer 99 to 100 percent UV protection."
"The Stanford mathematician says that single criminal acts are much more difficult to solve using mathematics, since there's no pattern yet to the criminal's behavior. He says one especially useful tool in these cases is image enhancement, which uses sophisticated mathematical techniques. Images taken from surveillance cameras, camera phones, and even helicopters, can be enhanced to show an incredible amount of detail that was not apparent before. ""You can enhance that image so not only can you recognize that person, but you can see details like tattoos on people's arms, and scars on their legs,"" remarks Devlin."
"Given the urgency of the problem, researchers have turned to stomach or bariatric surgery for diabetic patients. In two studies published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers at Ohio's Cleveland Clinic report surgery that reduced the size of the stomach — typically performed to remove cancerous tumors or speed weight loss in the morbidly obese — also reversed diabetes in 40 percent of patients. Italian researchers, reporting on the results of a more radical gastric procedure, say 75 percent of diabetes patients in their study went into remission, while 95 percent were effectively cured."
"To celebrate Valentine's Day (February 14), millions of Americans gave or received traditional gifts of the season… chocolate, flowers, jewelry. But Mary Esselman and Elizabeth Ash Velez favor a more literate approach to romance. The two writers share a love for poetry. They have always enjoyed reading, exchanging and collecting poems… especially love poems. Ms. Velez, an English Professor at Georgetown University, says most collections feature verses about unbelievably idealized love. So, when she and her friend compiled their collection, they chose love poems for real life, and called it You Drive Me Crazy."
"Dear Ursula,—There is a young man in Nemours who idolizes you. He cannot see you working at your window without emotions which prove to him that his love will last through life. This young man is gifted with an iron will and a spirit of perseverance which nothing can discourage. Receive his addresses favorably, for his intentions are pure, and he humbly asks your hand with a sincere desire to make you happy. His fortune, already suitable, is nothing to that which he will make for you when you are once his wife. You shall be received at court as the wife of a minister and one of the first ladies in the land."
"Maynard Ferguson was born on May 4, 1928, in Montreal, Canada. He began playing piano and violin at age four. At age nine, he discovered the trumpet. Four years later, he won a scholarship with the French Conservatory of Music, and was invited to perform with the Canadian Broadcasting Company Orchestra. As a student in Montreal, he was the leader of a warm-up band for some of the era's best-known orchestras, including Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey, Woody Herman and Dizzy Gillespie. In a 1996 interview, Ferguson said Dizzy Gillespie was second only to Louis Armstrong as his favorite horn player."
"Salinas is the heart of Steinbeck country — and the fertile ground for some of his best-known classics, like East of Eden and The Grapes of Wrath. The economic depression faced by the hard-working farmhands and fruit pickers he wrote about ended in the 1930's… but the now predominantly-Latino town of 150-thousand remains a struggling agricultural community. On a small side street, one of the town's three libraries bears Steinbeck's name. Outside the building, a statue of the Nobel Prize-winning author has a piece of rain-soaked cardboard dangling from its neck. It reads, 'Please do not close my library.'"
"Lance Mitchell is an interesting character. He's a hair colorist by trade, who lives with his wife in a fairly typical suburban apartment complex just outside Washington, D.C. He has tattoos on both arms and rings in both ears. He enjoys bicycling, and exploring caves, and says he was raised by Druids, practitioners of an ancient Celtic religion that emphasizes the connection between humans and other animals. That upbringing is one of the reasons Lance Mitchell feels so passionately about his snakes, one-meter and three-meter-long pythons, Georgie and Bert, and his two-meter-long boa constrictor, Medusa."
"Carnegie Hall in New York City is one of the most famous places for the performance of classical music. All of the world’s best musicians have played there. In nineteen-sixty, there were plans to tear down Carnegie Hall and build a tall office building in its place. Mister Stern organized a committee of citizens, politicians and artists to oppose the plan. He successfully led the effort to save Carnegie Hall. Then he became president of the newly-established Carnegie Hall Corporation. He held that office for forty years. In recent years, he gave a series of classes for young musicians at Carnegie Hall."
"Americans spend $48 billion a year on what's known as ""Complementary Alternative Medicine."" This includes everything from vitamins and herbal supplements, to acupuncture, massage therapy, and even coffee enemas. None of it is covered by medical insurance. Most of it is not regulated by the government, and nearly all of it is scorned by the traditional medical establishment in the United States. But, the popularity of alternative medicine is growing. Some say it's because alternative medicine works. Others blame the trend on the increasingly impersonal nature of America's traditional healthcare system."
"Two days later, toward noon, Sandy began to show signs of excitement and feverish expectancy. She said we were approaching the ogre's castle. I was surprised into an uncomfortable shock. The object of our quest had gradually dropped out of my mind; this sudden resurrection of it made it seem quite a real and startling thing for a moment, and roused up in me a smart interest. Sandy's excitement increased every moment; and so did mine, for that sort of thing is catching. My heart got to thumping. You can't reason with your heart; it has its own laws, and thumps about things which the intellect scorns."
"Several studies have found that men who take aspirin or other NSAIDs have a decreased risk of prostate cancer. The prostate is a gland and part of the male reproductive system. Researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota wanted to see how NSAIDs might affect prostates that are enlarged, but not cancerous. They followed the health of 2,500 men for 12 years. The researchers said these drugs may delay or stop development of an enlarged prostate. They said the risk of an enlarged prostate was 50 percent lower in the NSAID users than the other men. The risk of bladder problems was 35 percent lower."
"Uranus tilts over so far on its axis that it rotates on its side. Because of this, its poles are sometimes pointed almost directly at the Sun. Uranus' atmosphere is made up of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The temperature in the upper atmosphere is very cold. The cold methane gas is what gives Uranus its blue-green color. The rapid rotation of Uranus causes winds up to 600 kilometers per hour to blow in its atmosphere. Uranus has eleven known rings which contain dark, boulder-sized particles. Uranus has 27 named moons. Some of these moons are less than 100 kilometers wide and black as coal."
One of her famous photographs was taken in nineteen sixty-six. It is of a young transvestite. A transvestite is a man who dresses and acts like a woman. This man is wearing plastic objects in his hair to curl and shape it. He is also wearing makeup on his face to make it look more like a woman. The picture is taken from close up with severe lighting effects. In the dark centers of his eyes you can see the light from Arbus’ camera. You can see every detail and imperfection of his pale skin. He looks directly at you as though he has nothing to hide. His look is one of interest and acceptance.
"The World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the WHO, wants to see at least 50 percent of the world's children under 6 months of age exclusively breastfed by 2025. Reaching that target will require an investment of an additional $5.7 billion, or just $4.70 per newborn, for such things as improving breastfeeding practices in maternity facilities and improving access to lactation counseling — and it could generate $300 billion in economic gains across lower- and middle-income countries by 2025 and save 520,000 children's lives in the next 10 years, according to a World Bank study."
"When Rhodopis was bathing, an eagle snatched one of her sandals from her maid and carried it to Memphis; and while the king was administering justice in the open air, the eagle, when it arrived above his head, flung the sandal into his lap; and the king, stirred both by the beautiful shape of the sandal and by the strangeness of the occurrence, sent men in all directions into the country in quest of the woman who wore the sandal; and when she was found in the city of Naucratis, she was brought up to Memphis, became the wife of the king, and when she died was honoured with a great tomb."
"On raising our eyes to the moss-grown parapet, we beheld a figure sitting upon it that bore a very striking resemblance to the pictures in the Spanish Museum at Madrid of the early Aztec princes. It was a female, and she bore upon her head a most gorgeous headdress of feathers, called a Panache. Her face was calm, clear, and exceedingly beautiful. The nose was prominent—more so than the Mexican or Tezcucan—and the complexion much lighter. Indeed, by the gleam of the moonlight, it appeared as white as that of a Caucasian princess, and wore an expression full of benignity and love."
"“Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,” continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness. “Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. There is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it. But some foolish people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?”"
"Returning, I had to cross before the looking-glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed. All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality: and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie’s evening stories represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing before the eyes of belated travelers."
"Maelo was born in Santurce, the largest neighborhood in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in 1931. He worked as a shoeshiner and construction worker while playing music. He began playing percussion for Conjunto Monterrey de Munchito Muley in 1948 before singing with the Orquesta Panamericana in 1952. Maelo was the lead singer for Cortijo y su Combo from 1954 to 1962, performing music like bomba and plena with Rafael Cortijo on radio and television. These were Afro Puerto Rican musical genres, and Maelo was the first Black singer to appear singing on national television in Puerto Rico."
"Last week, we discussed one problem for medical journals: the question of authorship. You would think that all the scientists who took part in a research study would be listed as authors. But that is not always the case. Sometimes there are honorary authors and ghost authors. Honorary authors, also called guest authors, receive credit in a published study but had little to do with designing it or writing the article. Ghost authors work on studies but are not credited. Sometimes they are paid by drug companies to place articles in journals to support the company's products."
"On February 4, 1960, when we landed the aircraft within 100 yards of the 16 wolves on Intermediate Lake, the animals eventually scattered into the woods. A few minutes later we heard some howling, which soon increased in volume until the entire pack seemed to be involved. The whining, yelping, and howling (much of which was high-pitched) continued for about 30 seconds and then gradually diminished; a few single howls were emitted after the chorus had subsided. Tracks later showed that the wolves had assembled on a small knoll, where most of the howling probably originated."
"After our dinner we walked up to the foot of the cascade, along the margin of the transparent stream, which meandered amongst great boulders of rock; at the foot we found the rocks rose almost perpendicularly from a charming little basin, into which the stream from above and the spray from below mingled with a most melodious sound, so pleasant to the ear at any time, but how much more to our drought-accustomed senses; continually sounding like the murmur in the sea-shell, which, as the poets say, remembering its ancient and august abode, still murmurs as it murmured then."
"You’d be surprised how much mess 50 people in a large research station can create. Here at the South Pole, where it takes six months for the sun to rise, it only takes two days for a 30 gallon (113 liter) trashcan in the bathroom to be stuffed to the brim and overflowing with used paper towels. Hallway floors turn from bright white to off white in a little less than a week. Dust accumulates, in every corner, on every surface—the collective residue of the station residents’ epidermis, aggravated by dry air, frigid temperatures, and lackluster use of moisturizing lotions."
"“What do you think of that?” cried the detective, with the air of a showman exhibiting his show. “This was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The murderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where it has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See that candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall.”"
"According to a new World Bank publication, by the year 2050 world income will reach more than 135 trillion dollars, up from 35 trillion dollars today. For many analysts this growing wealth is proof that ""globalization,"" the term generally used for adopting a free-market economy and integrating into world markets, is improving the lives of many people around the world. But critics say fast economic growth has been, at best, uneven in many parts of the world and has had a negative impact on the environment, energy consumption, social justice and international security."
"Miguel, an engineer, and Rogelio, a farmer and businessman, met over their shared passion for clean energy and an appreciation for the nopal, or prickly pear cactus. Together, they have found unique ways to harness the power of the plant. They created the first filling station in the world to sell emission-free biogas made from cactus, and now they’re taking their vision to a younger generation. We join them as they embark on their newest venture—building a cactus-powered biotechnology system to run parts of the Technological Institute of Iztapalapa in Mexico City."
"Several recent studies published in The New England Journal of Medicine suggest that meat produced without antibiotics is healthier, not just for people with allergies, but for everyone, because it fights the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria. The studies say that commercially raised meat exacerbates the resistance problem in two ways. First, it contributes to the overuse of antibiotics in humans, since people ingest what the livestock is fed. Second, forms of antibiotic resistant bacteria that develop in some farm animals can actually be passed on to humans."
"The sport also requires a little ingenuity. The things he lifts in competition are a bit unusual, often looking more like debris from a construction site than regulation weights. For instance, one piece of equipment looks like a yoke with a concrete block attached to either end, another, like a large metal log. Therefore Mr. Pfister has to make most of his training equipment himself. The strongman even keeps an old car at his house to practice flipping over heavy objects. He uses these 180 kilo stone balls for a variety of exercises involving lifting and walking."
"He had not kept his bowels and nervous system, all his life long, under the influence of rum, tobacco, opium, coffee, tea, or highly seasoned food. He did not it is true, wholly deny himself any one of these, except opium and tobacco; but he only used them occasionally, and even then in great moderation. Nor was it from mere indigence, or culpable stinginess that he ate and drank, for the most part in a healthful manner. It seemed to be from a conviction of the necessity of being ""temperate in all things;"" and that such a course as he pursued tended to hardihood."
"The threat to peace resulting from continuing international tension and violations of the United Nations Charter, resulting in the unabated arms race, in particular in the nuclear field, as well as wars, armed conflicts, external domination, foreign occupation, acquisition of land by force, aggression, imperialism, colonialism, neocolonialism, racism, apartheid, gross violation of human rights, terrorism, repression, the disappearance of persons and discrimination on the basis of sex are major obstacles to human progress, specifically to the advancement of women."
"Andrei Davidov took up farming 10 years ago after a career in the military and a stint as a publisher. He took the proceeds from the sale of his publishing firm and began to buy land here in Kaluga from shareholders of an old collective farm. He now has over 600-hectares of rolling pastureland and some 150-head of cattle. He uses the Internet to order supplies, like his electric fencing, which he gets from the United States. Several small cottages surrounded by garden plots and apple trees are where Andrei, his wife Marina and some of their farm workers live."
Several experts have praised this new medical tool to examine patients. They say it shows the small intestine better than X-rays or a method called endoscopy. Endoscopy uses a long thin tube with a small camera on the end. Doctors place the tube down a patient’s throat all the way to the small intestine. The camera looks for growths or other problems. But endoscopes cannot reach all the way through the six meters of the small intestine. Endoscopy also requires medicine to ease pain or to put the patient to sleep. This examination must be done in a hospital.
"Miss Ashton had by degrees gathered her spirits, so far as to pay some attention to what was going on; and observing the restrained impatience of Ravenswood, contrasted with the peculiar determination of manner with which Caleb detailed his imaginary banquet, the whole struck her as so ridiculous that, despite every effort to the contrary, she burst into a fit of incontrollable laughter, in which she was joined by her father, though with more moderation, and finally by the Master of Ravenswood himself, though conscious that the jest was at his own expense."
"On July 10, 1962, the U.S. Patent Office, now the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, issues a patent for the three-point seat belt. The inventor was Swede Nils Bohlin, who worked for the Swedish automaker Volvo. Four years later, Congress passed a law requiring all new cars to include the three-point seat belt. While there have been some tweaks to Bohlin’s original, today’s seat belts are basically his design. Seat belts are credited with reducing traffic fatalities by 50%, and today it is estimated that more than 80% of Americans wear them when driving."
"Seahorses are fish that don't look like, swim like, or reproduce like fish. With a head resembling that of a tiny horse, seahorses and their biological cousins, sea dragons, live in shallow tropical seas and temperate waters. One of the world's leading seahorse research laboratories, dedicated to breeding the fish, is located in the seemingly-unlikely setting of a busy inner harbor in Baltimore, Maryland. The city's National Aquarium and its nearby lab have already successfully bred 12 species of seahorses and have a new exhibit of the fish on display."
"There was a large babyhouse, beautifully furnished; there were many dolls of various sizes, and little chests and trunks full of nicely made clothes for them to wear—night-clothes, morning wrappers, gay silks and lovely white dresses, bonnets and hats, shoes and stockings too, and ribbons and laces, for the lady dolls; and for the gentlemen, coats, hats, vests, cravats and everything that real grown-up men wear; and for the baby dolls there were many suits of beautiful baby clothes; and all made so that they could be easily taken off and put on again."
"Alright, I think you'll agree to this one. ""I am NOT dressing as a banana."" ""The Equestrian ponies want you to dress as a banana. It is your civic duty. ...Look, I have been making compromises. My new provision only makes you dress as a banana during state functions."" ""It does not belong in a budget plan, Luna."" ""Well, how else am I supposed to get you to dress as a banana? You have refused to be open to negotiations!"" ""You know we have two weeks to agree on a proper budget."" Two weeks later, after no agreement could be reached, the violence began."
"Marriage is not a simple act in which two individuals sign a paper. Marriage is an act in which two people declare before the law, before God, and before themselves that they will commit themselves to being friends, partners, everything necessary for the other's life to be happy. That he or she will feel happy to see his or her loved one happy. That you are committed to the life of the person you are marrying. Marriage is not a military or electoral obligation: it is the declaration that two people love each other and want to share a life together."
"A bull, stimulated either by the scarlet colour of Miss Ashton's mantle, or by one of those fits of capricious ferocity to which their dispositions are liable, detached himself suddenly from the group which was feeding at the upper extremity of a grassy glade, that seemed to lose itself among the crossing and entangled boughs. The animal approached the intruders on his pasture ground, at first slowly, pawing the ground with his hoof, bellowing from time to time, and tearing up the sand with his horns, as if to lash himself up to rage and violence."
"At the recent American Association for the Advancement of Science convention in Boston, I heard a guy talking about a partly frozen foam with ice crystals and air bubbles, with flocculated fat globules surrounding the air bubbles, and proteins and emulsifiers surrounding the flocculated fat globules. My mind began drifting until I realized he was actually talking about ice cream, one of my favorite topics. Only then did I begin to realize that ice cream scientists take their work as seriously as brain surgeons and rocket scientists, maybe more so."
"A few years ago, a group of experts examined studies of aspirin at the request of federal health officials in the United States. The experts said people with an increased risk of a heart attack should take a low-strength aspirin every day. Aspirin may help someone who is having a heart attack caused by a blockage in a blood vessel. Aspirin thins the blood, so the blood may be able to flow past the blockage. But experts say people should seek emergency help immediately. And they say an aspirin is no substitute for treatment, only a temporary help."
"Then your worship understands rhyming too? ""And better than thou thinkest,"" replied Don Quixote, ""as thou shalt see when thou carriest a letter written in verse from beginning to end to my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, for I would have thee know, Sancho, that all or most of the knights-errant in days of yore were great troubadours and great musicians, for both of these accomplishments, or more properly speaking gifts, are the peculiar property of lovers-errant: true it is that the verses of the knights of old have more spirit than neatness in them."""
"Monarch butterflies, instantly recognizable for their gold and black markings, are found in many places around the world. But only those east of the Rocky Mountains in North America make the longest annual insect migration. From their summer habitats in the north, every autumn 300 million butterflies fly south — more than 5,000 kilometers — to a few small forests in Mexico. And that’s the path that this unusual ultra-light aircraft will follow this year — piloted by a crew of documentary filmmakers, including lead pilot Francisco Gutierrez."
"Electric vehicles are gaining attention as an option for improving air quality and lessening United States dependence on imported oil. Research and development is under way on advanced battery and fuel cell technology and automakers are stepping up efforts to design electric vehicles for fleets and personal use. While today's technology is new, battery-powered vehicles have been around for a long time. Electrics flourished before the rise of the gasoline automobile and some 50,000 electric vehicles were in use in the United States by 1912."
"Linguistic prejudice comes from a nonsensical notion about what is right and wrong in a language. People that lean on this idea of superiority are as ignorant as those that refuse to acknowledge a language's evolution and enrichment. This rude attitude can be seen in many forms, but it's mostly seen in lesser-developed communities. It can also be found in lots of other places: the television, the radio, in language-learning sites...and the problem will never be fixed as long as someone's way of speaking is worth more than their character."
"But Cicero does not seem even to have had a religious sentiment to cover the nakedness of his political opportunism. Not only does he in the Tusculan Disputations put aside in the Platonic fashion all the Homeric tales which anthropomorphize and discredit the gods; but in his treatise On Divination he shows an absolute disbelief in all the recognized practices, including the augury which he himself officially practised; and his sole excuse is that they are to be retained “on account of popular opinion and of their great public utility.”"
"Leovigild had expelled the remaining soldiers of the Greek emperors from Spain, had suppressed the audacity of the Franks, who in their raids ravaged the Visigothic provinces beyond the Pyrenees, had put an end to the sort of monarchy that the Suevi had established in Gallaecia and had expired in Toledo, after having established political and civil laws, and peace and public order in its vast domains, which stretched from coast to coast, and also, crossing the mountains of Vasconia, covered a large portion of the former Narbonian Gaul."
"No one is sure exactly how many illegal immigrants are in the United States at the moment, though most estimates are in the eight to ten million range. Officials involved in drafting the president's proposal say there is room for all of them in the temporary worker program if enough jobs become available. They say workers who participate in the program are not precluded from applying for permanent residency or a green card. But these officials make clear participants will have no advantage over would-be immigrants applying from abroad."
"American jazz impresario George Wein turned 80 years old this month, but age isn't slowing down this globe-trotting music promoter. His pioneering series of jazz festivals, which started with private and public events in the 1950s in Newport, Rhode Island, and continue with this week's (Oct 28–30) Warsaw Jazz Festival in Poland, are credited with bringing the music festival concept to popular music. Year after year, they've also been showcasing the world's best jazz musicians, who readily praise Mr. Wein for his contributions to jazz."
"There have been inroads against ever growing urban illumination. The International Dark Sky Association in Tucson, Arizona, a group that claims 3,600 members in more than 70 countries, says efforts to curb excess light are under way from the Australian Outback to Britain's Sherwood Forest. In the Czech Republic, an anti-air pollution law also fights light pollution by requiring shielded fixtures to block upward beams. Laws have also been enacted in Chile, thanks to persuasive astronomers who staff the three big observatories there."
"Towards the end of the 1990s, several Asian countries lived one of their worst health nightmares. A new, highly pathogenic, strain of Avian Influenza known as H5N1 killed hundreds of people. Over the next years, more than 9-million chickens were destroyed in an effort to stem the epidemic. Scientists believe the H5N1 virus was transmitted from wild birds to domestic poultry and pigs, which then passed it to humans. H5N1 is just the latest of various influenza strains that have killed up to 100 million people over the last century."
"In youth we may have an absolutely new experience, subjective or objective, every hour of the day. Apprehension is vivid, retentiveness strong, and our recollections of that time, like those in a time spent in rapid and interesting travel, are of something intricate, multitudinous, and long-drawn-out. But as each passing year converts some of this experience into automatic routine which we hardly note at all, the days and the weeks smooth themselves out in recollection to a contentless unit, and the years grow hollow and collapse."
"Song Jian, a professor at Renmin University of China and deputy director of the Population and Development Research Center, told the Global Times on November 16 that encouraging couples to have children rested with implementing the measures announced in August to provide ""economic support, childcare services, and paid maternity leave, the reasonable sharing of childbearing costs and the construction of a childbearing-friendly social atmosphere, focusing on family needs, and balancing work and family for childbearing couples."""
"The Chesapeake Bay is a national, natural American treasure. It was formed 15,000 years ago when an immense glacier melted and flooded an ancient river valley. Today, the estuary marks where the Potomac and 150 other rivers, streams and creeks merge on their way to the Atlantic Ocean. The sprawling 166,000 square-kilometer watershed stretches through six states and the nation's capital, nourishing a multitude of land and marine species. It's also the source of fresh drinking water, food and recreation for 17 million people."
"The sprawling watershed, where the Potomac and several other great rivers merge on their way to the Atlantic Ocean, stretches over 166,000 square kilometers and encompasses six Atlantic coast states and the nation's capital. It nourishes a multitude of marine and terrestrial wildlife. It's the source of fresh drinking water, food and recreation for 17 million people. But in recent decades, rapid population growth, farm chemical runoff and industrial activity have polluted the bay and upset the watershed's delicate ecology."
"Without love, life can be cold and it can be cruel. Sometimes cruelty is deliberate — the action of bullies or bigots, or the inaction of those indifferent to another’s pain. But often, cruelty is simply born of life, a matter of fate or God’s will, beyond our mortal powers to comprehend. To suffer such faceless, seemingly random cruelty can harden the softest hearts, or shrink the sturdiest. It can make one mean, or bitter, or full of self-pity. Or, to paraphrase an old proverb, it can make you beg for a lighter burden."
"The problem with fundamentalists insisting on a literal interpretation of the Bible is that the meaning of words change. A prime example is 'Spare the rod, spoil the child'. A rod was a stick used by shepherds to guide their sheep to go in the desired direction. Shepherds did not use it to beat their sheep. The proper translation of the saying is 'Give your child guidance, or they will go astray.' It does not mean 'Beat the shit out of your child or he will become rotten', as many fundamentalist parents seem to believe."
"The adjutant bird (Leptoptilus dubius) is one of Nature’s little jokes. It is a caricature of a bird, a mixture of gravity and clownishness. Everything about it is calculated to excite mirth—its weird figure, its great beak, its long, thin legs, its conspicuous pouch, its bald head, and every attitude it strikes. The adjutant bird is a stork which has acquired the habits of the vulture. Forsaking to a large extent frogs and such-like delicacies, which constitute the normal diet of its kind, it lives chiefly upon offal."
"Earlier this month, The Lancet medical journal published findings from a study of aspirin and cancer. Researchers followed almost one thousand patients who had Lynch syndrome — a genetic condition that makes them likely to develop some cancers. One group of patients took six hundred milligrams of aspirin a day for at least two years. These patients had a sixty-three percent lower risk of colorectal cancer than those who took a harmless substance or placebo. The longer they took aspirin, the lower their risk of cancer."
"Ms. Lester has the tall, broad-shouldered look of a farm girl and sports a bright red baseball cap that reads ""cowgirl"". She's one of a group of volunteers setting up water tanks and fencing across a 200,000-hectare swath of northern Arizona. The tanks will eventually provide water to hundreds of elk, deer, antelope, and even cattle. ""I mean, they gotta drink, and in this kind of drought, you've gotta bring the water to them and take care of them, because they will suffer if we don't do something out here,"" she says."
"I can not prophesy what will be the outcome of the efforts which the Filipino women are now making to obtain suffrage; but I know that these efforts must be to them, and are to us, a source of pride and glory, because they show that there is no part of our people which has remained indifferent to the great movements of the century. There are persons who scoff at them and many shrug their shoulders; but this must not discourage our women, because neither scoffing nor shrugging the shoulders are very weighty arguments."
"It is important to keep in mind that while AI is becoming more advanced, it is not new. It’s been around for decades. You use AI every day without realizing it — for example, when you receive online shopping recommendations or have your text messages autocorrected. Beyond improving mundane tasks, AI is already transforming our world for the better. It’s detecting cybersecurity threats to critical infrastructure; improving agricultural yield; and with advancements, potentially enhancing cancer detection and treatment."
"Henry Shands directs the National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation. He says that every year, the seed lab and its cultivation centers send out 100,000 seed samples to people who request them from around the world. Some go to countries whose crops have been devastated by flood, disease, drought or war. Some go to other seed storage centers as well as university, government and industry labs. They all get mailed out in coin-sized packets, usually 50 seeds at a time. Dr. Shands says each packet is freely given."
"A human being is part of the whole, called by us Universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest — a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty."
"A periscope is an optical instrument that uses a system of prisms, lenses or mirrors to reflect images through a tube. Light from a distant object strikes the top mirror and is then reflected at an angle of 90 degrees down the periscope tube. At the bottom of the periscope, the light strikes another mirror and is then reflected into the viewer’s eye. This simple periscope uses only flat mirrors as compared to the periscopes used on submarines, which are usually a complex optical system using both lenses and mirrors."
"Glorious London! Leviathan of human greed; palpitating hot-bed of iniquity and joy; Greek, Roman, Spanish, Saxon, Kelt, Scot, Pict, Norman and Dane have swept over thee like winter storms; and the mighty Cæsar, Julius of old, with a myriad of bucklered warriors and one hundred galleons of sailors, triple-oared mariners, defying wave and fate, have ploughed the placid face of Father Thames, startling the loud cry of hawk and bittern as his royal prows grated on thy strand, or skimmed over the marshes of thy infancy."
"Officials from government and industry are also starting to recognize the potential of the Methane Capture Project. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is funding experimental on-farm sites in Mississippi and several other states. Some large poultry processors are launching renewable energy divisions to power their feed mills. And a fuel company is investigating the possibility of pumping chicken-waste methane instead of natural gas through its pipeline, and to use it to power some of the generators along the way."
"The manner of life in the large towns of Porto Rico is not dissimilar from that of European countries, with the exception of some slight differences due to the heat of the climate. The fashions for men and women alike are imported, especially from Paris and London. Those who are in comfortable circumstances dress just like people in European countries. The men wear woolen clothes all the year round. The young women dress very elaborately and all wear hats, the Spanish mantilla being adopted by elderly women only."
"In the cities nothing is more surprising to a foreigner than to go from the dust and turmoil of a busy street directly into a rustic yard and the felicity of quiet country life. On one of the busy streets of Tokio I had often passed a low shop, the barred front of which was never opened to traffic, nor was there ever any one present with whom to deal. I used often to peer between the bars; and from the form of the wooden boxes on the step-like shelves within, I knew that the occupant was a dealer in old pottery."
"Cross-pollination from birds, bees and other insects is of value to more than just coffee. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says two-thirds of the world's crops require it. But Mr. Ricketts and his colleagues point out that recent declines in wild and managed bee populations throughout the world have aroused concern, prompting the United Nations to create the International Pollinators Initiative. This is a program to coordinate scientific investigation on ways to conserve animal pollinators."
"During the last week the story had run from him with a facility that had surprised and delighted him; words came to him without effort, ranging themselves into line with the promptitude of well-drilled soldiery; sentences and paragraphs marched down the clean-swept spaces of his paper, like companies and platoons defiling upon review; his chapters were brigades that he marshaled at will, falling them in one behind the other, each preceded by its chapter-head, like an officer in the space between two divisions."
"Mr. Mercer, who in 1846 was the principal civil officer of Government at Badulla, sent me a jagged fragment of an elephant’s tusk, about five inches in diameter, and weighing between twenty and thirty pounds, which had been brought to him by some natives, who, being attracted by a noise in the jungle, witnessed a combat between a tusker and one without tusks, and saw the latter with his trunk seize one of the tusks of his antagonist and wrench from it the portion in question, which measured two feet in length."
"In the United States, when students graduate from high school, many celebrate that achievement by going to prom. It is a dance party where students dress up in formal gowns and tuxedos. But not every student who wants to go can afford to dress for the occasion. Organizations across the United States provide free dresses and suits so students can go to prom. A program called The Cinderella and Prince Charming Project allows teens from some of the roughest neighborhoods in the country to celebrate the milestone."
"Much attention recently has been given to efforts to unionize corporate giants Amazon and Starbucks in the United States. However, the ILO report highlights the important role collective bargaining plays in developing, as well as developed countries. Lead author of the ILO report Susan Hayter says 57 of the agreements reviewed were in African countries. She says country studies found that collective bargaining in those countries is as effective, if not in some ways more effective, than in developed countries."
"As the expeditions against the Pannonians and the Germans were, as it were, a repetition of the Raetian campaign on a more extended scale, so the leaders, who were put at their head with the title of imperial legates, were the same—once more the two princes of the imperial house, Tiberius, who, in the place of Agrippa, took up the command in Illyricum, and Drusus, who went to the Rhine, both now no longer inexperienced youths, but men in the prime of their years, and well fitted to take in hand severe work."
"Central Park also plays host to tens of thousands of runners during the final 5.1 kilometers of the world-famous 42-kilometer New York Marathon, as well as to summer performances of Shakespeare in the Park, the Metropolitan Opera and New York Philharmonic. More than 170 movies have been filmed inside the park, including the 1957 American classic, An Affair to Remember starring Cary Grant, and the more contemporary comedic love story, When Harry Met Sally starring Hollywood actors Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan."
"The changes have been praised by educators and psychologists — although the praise has been given cautiously. Jean Kilbourne is a documentary film-maker whose series, Killing Us Softly, is a critique of the images of women in western advertising. Ms. Kilbourne says the ""real girls"" that can now be found in teen magazines are a step in the right direction, but she is still highly critical of the industry's practice of retouching photographs, whether those pictures are of ""real girls"" or professional models."
"When an English speaker realises that a foreign person they are speaking to doesn't understand one of their sentences, they repeat it, the same way, but louder, as though the person were deaf. At no point does it come to their mind that their vocabulary might be complicated or that their expression might most probably be ambiguous to a foreigner and that they could reword it in a simpler way. The result is that not only does the person still not understand, but they get irritated at being considered deaf."
"Doctor Kazura and his team of researchers tested the drug recently in Papua New Guinea. They gave the drug to two-thousand-five-hundred people living in unpopulated areas of the country. The people were injected with the drug every year for four years. Scientists found that the spread of lymphatic filariasis dropped by more than ninety-five percent. They also discovered that the treatment reduced the enlargement of the arms, legs and reproductive organs. Doctors had thought this was a permanent condition."
"Purdue University professor, Japanese Ei'ichi Negishi is a co-recipient of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He shares the award with Japanese Akira Suzuki of Hokkaido University and American Richard Heck of the University of Delaware. Together, their work created a method to build complex organic molecules that are now used to manufacture a range of products — from pharmaceuticals to electronics. Our correspondent spoke with Negishi at his office in Indiana shortly after the Nobel announcement was made."
"Visitors to New York's American Museum of Natural History are not likely to forget their first encounter with the giant blue whale suspended from the ceiling of the Museum's Hall of Ocean Life. But the beloved, 30-meter long icon was anatomically incorrect until a recently-completed renovation to the model, part of the entire Hall's refurbishment, put things right. The renovated exhibition hall, like the whale, better depicts the undersea world, and better reflects the Museum's dedication to conservation."
"It was true that the birds were everywhere! little greenish birds flitting among the trees; larger grey-brown birds flying low; fairy-like blue and yellow birds that circled round the car as it ran east towards the far, looming mountains of the Djurdjura; larks that spouted music like a fountain of jewels as they soared into the quivering blue; and great, stately storks, sitting in their nests on tall trees or tops of poles, silhouetted against the sky as they gazed indifferently down at the automobile."
"It seems there are always members of the scientific community who are eager for the chance to knock the air out of Albert Einstein's nearly 100 year-old General Theory of Relativity. This milestone work describes how the elemental force of gravity helps to shape the geometry of space and time. And some of its predictions — involving phenomena like the dilation of time, the motion of bodies in free fall and the gravitational bending of light — are mind-bendingly different than those of classical physics."
"The article that David Borgenicht was reading told people how they might safely land a small plane if the pilot passes out. It got him thinking about other hair-raising situations in movies and TV shows. Of course it’s one thing for an action hero to leap from a moving motorcycle into a car or fend off a killer shark. But how would ordinary, out-of-shape readers do it? How would they wrestle free from an alligator, for example, or survive if their parachutes do not open, or escape from a mountain lion?"
"So, how did aspirin become so important? The story begins with a willow tree. Two thousand years ago, the Greek doctor Hippocrates advised his patients to chew on the bark and leaves of the willow. The tree contains the chemical salicin. In the 1800s, researchers discovered how to make salicylic acid from salicin. In 1897, a chemist named Felix Hoffmann at Friedrich Bayer and Company in Germany created acetyl salicylic acid. Later, it became the active substance in a medicine that Bayer called aspirin."
"But Mona had no thought for kettles, or tea, or granny either, for her whole mind, her eyes, her ears, and all her senses were with the heroine of the fascinating story she was absorbed in; and who could remember fires and kettles and other commonplace things when one was driving through a lovely park in a beautiful pony carriage, drawn by cream-coloured ponies, and seated beside an exquisitely dressed little lady who had more money than she could count, and insisted on sharing all with her companion?"
"The recent outbreak of monkeypox in the American mid-west, and its connection to prairie dogs that were kept as pets, has focused attention on so-called ""exotic pet ownership."" Here in America, it's not at all unusual for people to keep domesticated animals like dogs, or cats, or horses as pets. But prairie dogs are wild animals, and because of that, some people believe they shouldn't be owned. But as VOA's Maura Farrelly found out, dogs aren't the only wild animals being brought into American homes."
"Researcher Mauro Ferrari, with the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, has been studying the medical applications of nanotechnology. He agrees that the risks are very small, and the potential benefits are huge in comparison. He predicts, for example, that nanotech-enhanced screening could significantly cut the number of cancer-related deaths. And, he says, government policy makers and scientists have an ethical responsibility to spread such benefits to as many people as possible."
"From a few mud houses beyond a rising ground, not far from the river, came several men and women, bringing peaches and melons in their ponchos, together with baskets of native manufacture, filled with two kinds of grapes, one variety of which was the white Muscatel. At different points near this river my attention had been attracted by a disease very prevalent among the people, which exhibited itself in the form of a large swelling upon the throat, and was called by the natives the coté (goitre)."
"The king usually moves to any square next to his. But in chess there is a special move called castling, which can be done in two different ways, depending on the situation. In the first case, relating white, the king goes from e1 to g1 and the rook comes from h1 to f1. It's the short castling. In the second case, and still dealing with white, the king goes from e1 to c1 and the rook comes from a1 to d1. It's the long castling. This is the only time when two pieces are displaced in the same move."
"The colonists in North America in seventeen sixty-three were very different from those who had settled there more than one hundred years before. They had different ideas. They had come to consider their colonial legislatures as smaller, but similar to the British Parliament in London. These smaller parliaments had helped the colonists rule themselves for more than one hundred years. The colonists began to feel that their legislatures should also have the powers that the British Parliament had."
"Under the Tatoeba guidelines, it is recommended that members only add sentences in their native language and/or translate from a language they can understand into their native language. The reason for this is that it is much easier to form natural-sounding sentences in one's native language. When we write in a language other than our native language, it is very easy to produce sentences that sound strange. Please make sure you only translate the sentence if you are sure you know what it means."

"We all have to study math in school at one time or another. And many of us have wondered: will this stuff be useful afterward, in real life? Mathematicians Keith Devlin and Gary Lorden answer an emphatic ""yes"". In their new book, The Numbers Behind ""Numb3rs,"" they argue that math is especially useful in the science of crime-solving: the subject of the popular TV show, Numb3rs. The authors make the case that the stories on the show might be fictional, but the critical role of math is very real."
"Green tea gets a good review in the Journal of Periodontology. The March issue includes a study which analyzed a number of lifestyle factors for 940 middle-age Japanese men, including tooth brushing, smoking and green tea consumption. It found that participants who drank green tea had less periodontitis or gum disease. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the gums and bone supporting the teeth. It's caused by bacteria in the mouth and is made worse by poor oral hygiene."
"A larger excavation in the side of the hill facing the sea, with a flight of steps leading up from it into another smaller recess, and numerous lateral openings and subterranean passages, supposed to penetrate into the very heart of the mountain, and even to communicate with Lake Fusaro, is pointed out by the local guides as the Sibyl's Cave, which, as Virgil tells us, had a hundred entrances and issues, from whence as many resounding voices echoed forth the oracles of the inspired priestess."
"The discovery of antibiotics in the 20th century brought remarkable changes to modern medicine, enabling people to live longer, healthier lives. But in the last generation, new strains of bacteria have emerged that are resistant to these wonder drugs. One of the main causes of resistance is the overuse of antibiotics. That includes drugs given to commercially raised livestock. Leda Hartman profiles a family farm in the state of North Carolina that is raising meat without the use of chemicals."
"This series of buildings looks like an ancient home for kings. Huge rounded and box-like buildings have windows in the shape of circles and triangles. The structure is surrounded by water. From a distance, it appears to float on a lake. Kahn spent the last twelve years of his life on the project. It was completed in nineteen eighty-three, nine years after his death. Because of Kahn, experts say, one of the poorest countries in the world has one of the most beautiful public buildings on Earth."
"It is a small country but about 750 million plastic bags are used in New Zealand each year. Surveys show most people support the ban on lightweight single-use bags that the government says are an environmental menace. Retailers who flout the law could face heavy fines and shoppers are encouraged to report offenders, while random checks by officials are also planned. But authorities say their initial approach will be to educate companies about their responsibilities before fines are imposed."
"What began 21 months ago in the depths of winter cannot end on this autumn night. This victory alone is not the change we seek. It is only the chance for us to make that change. And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were. It can't happen without you, without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice. So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other."
"Many people around the world thought Saturday, July 7th, 2007, might be the luckiest day of the century. That's because in the Gregorian Calendar, it was the seventh day of the seventh month of the seventh year. This might explain why about three times as many weddings were reported that day in the U.S. as for a typical Saturday in July. On the other hand, the 13th day of July falls on a Friday — a coincidence many believe brings bad luck. Why are these numbers so meaningful to some people?"
"In modern professional tennis, winning a big tournament is considered a greater achievement than winning several smaller tournaments of the same combined value. Hence, top players typically concentrate on bigger tournaments and only play a few smaller ones in between. Consequently, top players play and win fewer matches than before. Since Ivan Lendl won 106 out of 115 matches he played in 1982, nobody won more than 90 matches in a single season, except Roger Federer, who went 92-5 in 2006."
"In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farm-house close by a deep river, and from the house down to the water side grew great burdock leaves, so high, that under the tallest of them a little child could stand upright. The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood. In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom had any visitors."
"As president of the National Association of Colored Women, Terrell supported the women’s suffrage movement, even picketing at the White House to demand equal treatment. After anti-discrimination laws were overturned in Washington in the 1890s, Terrell led a campaign to reinstate laws protecting African Americans. She continued to fight against segregation through boycotts and sit-ins. In 1953, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that segregated eating places in Washington were unconstitutional."
"In an interview six years ago, Henry Loomis remembered an experiment he took part in when he was about seventeen years old. Henry slept in a sound-proof room with electrode devices attached to his head. Alfred Loomis was nearby with a microphone device. He told his son in a soft voice that Henry's favorite object, his boat, was on fire. Henry Loomis jumped out of bed to save the boat. This experiment and others helped Alfred Loomis show how emotional upset could change human brain waves."
"When science is boring or hard to learn, people shy away from it. That's why many U.S. universities sponsor road shows staffed with educators who try to make science fun. One of the largest and best-known outreach programs is The Little Shop of Physics at Colorado State University. Founded by CSU Physics professor Brian Jones in 1991, this toyshop for scientists produces gadgets and gizmos that turn concepts like magnetism and osmosis into something kids can actually get their hands on."
"The poet’s business is not with facts as such, or with inferences, but with truth of feeling, and the very spirit of truth. His function is ideal; that is, from the prosaic, the individual, the limited, he is to lift us up to the universal, the generic, the boundless. In compassing this noble end he may, if such be his bent, use the facts and feelings and individualities of daily life; and, by illuminating and ennobling them he will approve his human insight, as well as his poetic gift."
"At his campaign stops, Democratic Presidential Candidate John Kerry discusses his vision for the nation, strengthening rural communities or investing in renewable fuels. His two daughters take a more personal approach, visiting with local volunteers and families, and telling some Kerry family stories. They tell voters how their father saved their hamster's life, or makes pancakes on a Saturday morning. They are out there sharing the excitement of the campaign while also taking the heat."
"McDonald's recently celebrated its 50th birthday, and the American fast food giant is planning to make its second half-century as revolutionary as its first. As it faces increased competition from other types of food outlets, the world's largest restaurant chain is stepping out in a brand new style, hoping to attract new fans with a new emphasis on healthier foods like salads. And at some McDonald's restaurants, the emphasis is decidedly high-tech… and not at all related to hamburgers."
"The researchers are from the University of California at San Francisco. They say their research shows that two drugs can clear the infectious proteins from mouse brain cells. The drugs are quinacrine and chlorpromazine. Quinacrine was used in the Nineteen-Forties to treat malaria. Chlorpromazine is used to treat the mental disorder schizophrenia. Quinacrine appears to be more effective in stopping the deadly protein activity. However, chlorpromazine crosses more easily into the brain."
"Tom Hanks, at fifty-four, has one of the most successful and extensive careers in Hollywood. He has acted in television shows and movies, and done voice work for animated films. He is also a movie director, producer and writer. He currently is part of the leadership of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. For some time he was the Academy’s Vice President. He won the Academy Award for best actor in back to back years. Spencer Tracy is the only other actor to have done that."
"Back when we were a nation of 200 million people, 38 percent of us lived in the suburbs. Now fully HALF of our 300 million people do. Housing tracts have displaced pastures and quiet copses and turned suburbs into centers of economic and political power. And everything you may have heard about explosive growth in what we call the ""Sun Belt"" is true. Just about half of our 300 million people now live in the sunny South and West. That's twice as many people as lived there 39 years ago."
"Coyotes are found throughout the United States (except Hawaii) and in most of Canada. Prior to 1900, coyotes were restricted to areas west of the Mississippi in the United States and west of Ontario’s Lake Nipigon in Canada. The coyote’s success is attributed to the coyote’s ability to adapt. Coyotes have adjusted well to human disturbed environments, and now thrive in close proximity to people. The coyote is a member of the canid family, which includes both wolves and domestic dogs."
"Drawn by some strange force, from the unfathomable depths below, eerie shapes sought the surface, blinking glassily at the unfamiliar glare they had exchanged for their native gloom—uncouth creatures bedight with tasselled fringes like weed-growths waving around them, fathom-long, medusae with coloured spots like eyes clustering all over their transparent substance, wriggling worm-like forms of such elusive matter that the smallest exposure to the sun melted them, and they were not."
"On March 6, 1857, the United States Supreme Court rules on the case of Dred Scott v. Sandford, effectively declaring that blacks, slaves or freemen, could not be U.S. citizens. Furthermore, it ruled that the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which ensured pro- and anti-slavery states would be added to the union in pairs to preserve balance, was unconstitutional. The decision inflamed and widened the differences between pro- and anti-slavery Americans, ultimately leading to the Civil War."
"Three years ago, Washington, DC launched an ambitious program to provide free books to every one of its youngest residents. Today, the program is a huge success with nearly 80 percent (33,518) of District children under age five enrolled. VOA’s Julie Taboh sat down with a participating family to find out what impact the program has had on their child, and spoke with key members behind the initiative to learn about the successful collaborations that have made their mission possible."
"At night the savage cry of the wolf too often disturbed the rest of the scattered dwellers in that vast forest, and made a belated traveller look well to the sharpness of his weapons and the temper of his bowstring; but by day and in the sunlight the forest was beautiful and quiet enough—something too quiet, perhaps, for the taste of the two handsome lads who were pacing the dim aisles together, their arms entwined and their curly heads in close proximity as they walked and talked."
"But restoring the Chesapeake also means considering how we build our homes, office buildings and factories. George Hawkins, director of the District Department of the Environment in Washington, says communities in the watershed are designing new buildings that conserve energy and water and pollute less. They are also upgrading older buildings to green standards and protecting land from development. Hawkins says individual actions can make a huge difference in the bay's restoration."
"The same licensed nurse-midwife will attend her, bringing along the emergency equipment of a paramedic, just in case. Although most problems in labor are detected in plenty of time, several top hospitals are only a few minutes away, Jacobs noted. Ten percent of planned home births do end up in the hospital, usually because labor has failed to progress. But if all goes well, Jacobs will have a peaceful, unmedicated birth — with no high-tech monitoring, surgery or drug-induced labor."
"Since 1945, more land has been converted to agriculture, than in the 18th and 19th centuries combined. At least a quarter of all fish stocks are over-harvested. Ten to 30 percent of mammal, bird and amphibian species are currently threatened with extinction. One-third of the world's population is living in water-scarce or water-stressed areas, and this is projected to double over the next 25 years. But, climate change may do more damage to the Earth than all of these other factors."
"To make sure the instrument was ready for the harsh environment, the researchers needed to mimic the Sun’s intense heat radiation in a lab. To create a test-worthy level of heat, the researchers used a particle accelerator and IMAX projectors — jury-rigged to increase their temperature. The projectors mimicked the heat of the Sun, while the particle accelerator exposed the instrument to radiation to make sure it could measure the accelerated particles under the intense conditions."
"On a Thursday morning at the state Hall of Records in Annapolis, Maryland, about 60 kilometers east of Washington, D.C., a dozen or so people were in the microfilm room, looking at photocopies of land deeds, tax rolls, and church records dating back to the 1630s, when Maryland was first founded as a British colony. Another 10–15 people were in the main hall, carefully transcribing documents often worm-eaten and brittle with age, the words within them sometimes grossly misspelled."
"Read this paragraph carefully and remember this: Pescara is a pass through the Apennines, the mountain range that extends the length of the Italian Peninsula. You might call this trivia, or some sort of geography lesson. But in fact, it's an example of a new kind of exercise. Not for your muscles, but for that blob inside your skull. New federally-funded research shows that ten mental drills each day keep the brain fit today and help fend off forgetfulness in middle and old age."
"Mr. Erdogan will not only see Mr. Chirac and Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin during his three-day visit. He has also scheduled meetings with French businessmen, the two main political parties and representatives of France's sizable Turkish community. The Turkish leader says he will emphasize how his government has adapted its laws to those of the EU, and explain that the vast majority of Turks see EU membership as a national project to modernize and Westernize their country."
"The Hubble Telescope has given us spectacular pictures from space, from the dramatic image of the Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula, some 6,500 to 7,000 light years from Earth, to a snapshot of nearly 10,000 galaxies, including some that may be among the most distant known, existing when the universe was just 800 million years old. Awe-inspiring though they are, they are not detailed enough to help us in our search for life in the trillions of galaxies across the universe."
"On November 19, Country legend Charlie Daniels will host the 11th annual ""Christmas For Kids Benefit Concert"" at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium. Also on the bill are Montgomery Gentry, Chris Young, Rodney Atkins and Taylor Swift. Proceeds go to 300 local school children, who will be escorted to a Wal-Mart store on December 18. Each will receive $150 to spend on anything they want. The children will be chauffeured from their schools to Wal-Mart by a Country star's luxury tour bus."
"The brightening of the night also worries biologists, who say artificial lighting disrupts bird migration and the development and behavior of several other animals. At a recent [21-22 Feb.] Washington meeting of experts from several fields to discuss the night, evolutionary biologist Bryant Buchanan of Utica College in New York State cited studies showing that fewer frogs and salamanders metamorphose when the night sky is lighter, and pond snails do not grow as large as normal."
"By the way, the goal of the 1000 Genomes project isn't to sequence the genetic code of exactly 1,000 people. Instead, the aim is to identify genetic variations that occur in at least one out of every 100 people or one percent. In particular, that will require using genetic material from many thousands of people from all over the world. And it will need to include a lot more geographic diversity. Only a handful of genomes from Latin America and Africa have been sequenced so far."
But space junk falling on housetops is not the biggest worry. Scientists are concerned about the “Kessler” syndrome. It is named for the American scientist who first thought of the idea in nineteen seventy-eight. Imagine what happens when an empty rocket strikes another while orbiting the earth. Two big things become many smaller things. They then hit other things. The pieces get smaller and smaller until they form a cloud of junk that blocks the path of future space vehicles.
"From biology to ecology to medicine, the biosciences are recognized globally as dynamic drivers of modern economic progress. For young college graduates, majoring in one of the biosciences can open a whole host of career possibilities. But a new study finds that many schools across the United States are not doing enough to motivate or prepare students to pursue bioscience studies in college. The study's authors suggest some ways that American educators can turn things around."
"While some people own mobile phones simply to make or receive calls, for others they are the ultimate fashion accessory. Targeting this group, Korea's LG Electronics has teamed up with Italian luxury goods designer Prada to produce designer mobile phones. The phones, featuring a touch interface that replaces the conventional keypad, will be launched in Europe next year, and will be available soon after in a number of Asian locations, including Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore."
"Production costs of the so called $100 laptops are actually around $188. And for two weeks in November, North Americans will be able to buy two for about $400. The plan announced earlier this week is called ""Give One Get One."" For every laptop bought, one is shipped to a child in the developing world. The buyer gets a $200 tax deduction. The computers can be hand cranked and charged with solar power. That led one boy in a focus group to say they even prevent global warming."
"Bedbug infestations have been reported in towns and cities in every American state in the last few years, according to experts at the federal government’s second annual bedbug summit, held in early February in Washington, D.C. The insectile invasion of American homes and public places is expected to worsen. Experts say that increased resistance to pesticides means the tiny insects, which feed on warm-blooded animals, are here to stay, especially in densely-populated cities."
"On the U.S. Pacific island state of Hawaii, an invasive predator is threatening many native bird species with extinction. The predator is the mongoose, a non-native mammal introduced to the island chain over a century ago to control rats in the sugar cane fields. Now, environmental groups say, it's the mongoose that's out of control, feeding on the eggs and chicks of the island's many ground-nesting birds, including several endangered species that lay just one egg per year."
"Audubon was blessed with good health, length of years, a devoted and self-sacrificing wife, and a buoyant, sanguine, and elastic disposition. He had the heavenly gift of enthusiasm—a passionate love for the work he set out to do. He was a natural hunter, roamer, woodsman; as unworldly as a child, and as simple and transparent. We have had better trained and more scientific ornithologists since his day, but none with his abandon and poetic fervour in the study of our birds."
"This is the fourth piece in a five-part series on the Potomac River, the waterway in the eastern United States that flows through four U.S. States and metropolitan Washington DC into the Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in North America. In a canoe trip down the river VOA's Rosanne Skirble explores the natural riches of the Potomac and the struggle to protect the land and water resources of the river in the face of population growth, sprawling development and pollution."
"So let's see how you did on your first brain-strengthening exercise. What country, what mountain range, and — even trickier — what alpine pass did we mention just a minute or so ago? Don't remember, even though we specifically asked you to? How about this? Can you multiply the number 17 by two, three, four — all the way to ten without pausing or writing anything down? No can do? Well, good friend, you are an excellent candidate for a daily regimen of mental jumping jacks."
"During the spring of 1931, Ben Black Elk translated his father's words for writer John Neihardt. In the years that followed, and particularly after his father's death in 1950, Ben Black Elk became one of the last links to the ""old ways"" of his people. He often visited local schools to retell traditional stories of Lakota history and culture to students. Some of those sessions were recorded by Lakota educator Warfield Moose, Sr., who entrusted the tapes to his son in 1996."
Other artists in the exhibit use unwanted or reused materials in their art to express the environmental meaning of “green.” Artist Jackie Abrams spent time living and working with women basket weavers in Ghana. She says she was influenced to make baskets using waste materials. Her colorful artwork “A Woman of Substance” is a container made from old pieces of women’s clothing. Artist William Knight used old automobile tires to make an airy and finely cut wall sculpture.
"The city of Milwaukee recently joined the short list of communities that try to shame problem landlords. City officials called the news media to a dilapidated duplex in a low-income neighborhood. And with television cameras rolling, a city crew put up a one by 2.5 meter sign in the front yard. It stated the owner's name and the fact that the building has outstanding code violations. The tactic worked. Just a few days later, the city crew was back to take down the sign."
"If you were a sailor before the invention of modern navigational equipment, lighthouses were treasured beacons for wandering seafarers. They once dotted U.S. coastlines. But with advances in navigation equipment, lighthouses have become obsolete and many are no longer used for navigational purposes by major shipping traffic. Many lighthouses are threatened by changes in geography due to erosion and natural disasters, are vandalized, or are in desperate need of repair."
"Quinn worked in fiction writing and editing for various magazines before switching her genre to science writing halfway through her undergraduate degree. Since then, she has written mostly for scientific institutions, including the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC), Fermilab, and NOAA. She still dabbles in fiction and one day might finish the novel she's been writing since middle school. As long as she is getting to play with words all day, she's happy."
"Why does math seem to come easily to some folks and baffle others? Studies at Cornell University have shown that some people would rather write a long essay, for instance, than be put on the spot to come up with the correct answer to a math problem. They'd even prefer to make a speech than to go to the blackboard and add and subtract numbers in front of others. Children who've done it and come up with wrong answers often enough can develop a lifetime phobia for math."
"Sixty percent of preterm births occur in Africa and South Asia. The rate of preterm births in the U.S. has fallen to 11.5 percent, but that's still the highest rate of preterm births in any industrialized country. The March of Dimes has funded studies and set up centers to find ways to cut this rate. McCabe pointed out that scientists at Stanford University found a difference in the bacteria in women's vaginas that may be critical in the understanding of prematurity."
"One study was begun in nineteen eighty-three by Charles Hennekens of Harvard University Medical School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He began studying more than twenty-two-thousand healthy male doctors over the age of forty. Half of the doctors in the study took an aspirin every other day. The other half took an inactive pill. Five years later, Doctor Hennekens reported that the men who took aspirin reduced their chances of having a heart attack by forty-four percent."
"Almost involuntarily she took a step forward, but her foot slipped, she tottered and fell. Fortunately the stones near the path were overgrown with moss, but still the fall nearly stunned her, and she cried wildly for help. In vain! her voice could not reach Clement, who stood close to the abyss, surrounded by the roarings of the fall, and the house was far too distant. A bitter pain shot through her heart as she lay there between the stones, neglected and helpless."
"At a conference on the impact of human trafficking on economic development, Ambassador Lagon said that precise figures are difficult to obtain. But he said the U.S. estimates that some eight-hundred-thousand people are trafficked transnationally each year and millions more are enslaved in their own countries. The majority of trafficking victims are women. About two-thirds of all transnational trafficking victims are prostituted, and the victims keep getting younger."
"Halley's Comet is the best known because it can be seen with the naked eye as it passes by periodically. It was first noticed more than 2,000 years ago. Astronomers have observed and documented its appearances, which has helped them understand comets in general. The comet was named after 17th-century British astronomer Edmond Halley, who computed the rate of its movement from his 1682 observations and predicted that it would reappear in 1758, long after his death."
"Scientists at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, after analyzing data from NASA's Kepler space telescope, calculated that six percent of the galaxy's 75 billion red dwarf stars have potentially habitable, Earth-sized planets. Red dwarfs — which are smaller, cooler and much dimmer than our own Sun — are the most common stars in the galaxy, so the closest Earth-like planet could be just 13 light years away, the astronomers conclude in their new study."
"And if you think there are more commercials breaking up the action on the field than there used to be, you're right. Last year's Super Bowl telecast included a record 45 minutes and five seconds of air time for commercials. But the biggest Super Bowl advertiser is not a carmaker or beer or fast food sponsor. That distinction belongs to the broadcast network (this year CBS) itself, which takes as much as one-quarter of the commercial time to promote its own shows."
"A new survey shows that Internet freedom has declined around the world for the fourth consecutive year, as a growing number of countries impose various forms of online censorship and monitoring practices. Rights group Freedom House on Thursday issued an annual report that says more people are being arrested for their Internet activities than ever before, and online media outlets are increasingly pressured to comply with government requests for data or deletions."
"In rare instances over the years, chronic wasting disease has infected commercial elk herds throughout North America. The problem has been dealt with in various ways. Occasionally, an entire herd has been quarantined or destroyed to prevent further contagion. But sometimes, the disease has been overlooked, since it may take more than 18 months before a seemingly healthy elk shows signs of CWD, and it's easy to misdiagnose without testing a dead elk's brain stem."
"He never set out to work in the computer field or in business, and he certainly had no notions of becoming massively wealthy. He’s a multi-billionaire, for the record. No, what Reid Hoffman planned on becoming was a professor of philosophy. He’s still happy to expound upon the differences between analytic philosophers and continental philosophers. He knows his empiricism from his logical positivism, and as you’ll hear, computers found a way into his philosophy."
"Before plumbing came to the farm, this small building served as the site's toilet. It is a reconstruction—the original was torn down. This outhouse features a seat with two holes. This was not unusual as many outhouses had different sized holes for adults and children. There are also some pages from an old Sears and Roebuck Catalog in the structure. Farmers wouldn't waste money on purchasing toilet paper when they could recycle something they no longer needed!"
"The exuberance of the style and its tricky capriciousness may be, and are, condemned by purists as in questionable taste; but as an outcome of national feeling, and as an example of original inventive ingenuity and patience, this and other notable specimens of the style, to which reference will be made later, are of the highest interest to the student, and a delight to the ordinary observer who can free himself from the straightlaced traditions of the schools."
"Science would later disabuse us of the notion that the moon is made of green cheese — or is even green — but scientists aren't poets and perhaps that's why there doesn't seem to be the same enthusiasm for space exploration that there once was. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that, when asked to name the greatest U.S. accomplishment of the past 50 years, just 12 percent of Americans named sending men to the moon, down a third from 10 years ago."
"Since then, Indian white-backed vulture numbers have plummeted from 30 or 40 million birds to just thousands. This massive decline has left scientists scratching their heads about how many vultures are left in central and south Asia and other parts of the world. Because vultures move around a lot, it's been hard to keep track of individuals. There's never been an accurate total population count — anywhere. That's where Katzner and the National Aviary come in."
"Every April, in the weeks leading up to Earth Day, tens of thousands of volunteers converge on parks, forests and streams throughout the sprawling, four-state Potomac River watershed, on America's East Coast. They come to gather up and haul away hundreds of tons of trash before it winds up in the Potomac — the main drinking water source for towns and cities across the region. Our reporter joined some volunteers on a recent weekend cleanup and has this report."
"Both Decadence and Aestheticism, as intellectual movements, have fallen into the nadir of oblivion, and the dust lies heavy upon them, but they left a little leaven to lighten the heavy inertness of correct and academic literature; and now Symbolism, a greater movement than either, is in the ascendant, giving another turn to the wheel, and to all who think deeply about such matters it seems as though Symbolist literature is to be the literature of the future."
"If by a ""Liberal"" they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people-their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights and their civil liberties-someone who believes we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if that is what they mean by a ""Liberal"", then I'm proud to say I'm a ""Liberal""."
"Electrophoresis is a laboratory technique used to separate DNA, RNA or protein molecules based on their size and electrical charge. An electric current is used to move the molecules through a gel or other matrix. Pores in the gel or matrix work like a sieve, allowing smaller molecules to move faster than larger molecules. To determine the size of the molecules in a sample, standards of known sizes are separated on the same gel and then compared to the sample."
"These models, or ""population viability analyses,"" assess the risk of extinction over time based on computational iterations that play out how a herd may expand and contract (with births and deaths) and genetically evolve given the interplay of the number, age and sex of animals in the herd; reproductive traits; influx of new genetics vs. inbreeding; management actions (culling/hunting); and potential effects of random events such as disease, drought and fire."
"It is now legal in Washington, D.C. for people 21 and older to possess marijuana for recreational use. People are allowed to have a small amount of the drug, and to share it with others. But they can't smoke it in public, or buy it or sell it. Washington residents are allowed to grow up to six plants for their personal use in their homes — so to help marijuana users grow their own plants, a local pro-cannabis group recently held two marijuana seed exchanges."
"The Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas is another famous building by Louis Kahn. Some say it is his best. Kahn built this museum in the early nineteen seventies. This large museum has long rooms with curved or vaulted ceilings. Inside, all of the walls can be moved to best fit the art collection. Kahn was able to make the concrete material of the building look both solid and airy. He used sunlight and bodies of water to create a truly special building."
"The new home is more than one-thousand square meters. Work crews used almost ninety-one-thousand kilograms of steel to build it. About one-fifth of the steel is covered with a chemical that kills bacteria, mold and other organisms. A Massachusetts company, AgION Technologies, produces the chemical. The heating, airflow and cooling systems all are made with the treated steel. So are food preparation surfaces and other ""high-touch"" areas, along with the roof."
"Carbon dioxide emissions produced by burning fossil fuels are the major cause of global warming, so efforts to combat climate change have focused on ways to cut CO₂ releases. But according to the new study published this week in the journal Science, a quicker and more effective strategy would be to reduce emissions of other, shorter-lived air pollutants. The measures would not just slow climate change, but also boost crop yields, save money, and save lives."
"Most farmers in Africa are women. But a South African NGO says many factors are keeping them poor. This, it says, contributes to food shortages on the continent because the women don’t have enough resources to produce significant amounts of food. The Food, Agriculture and Natural Resources Policy Analysis Network is developing strategies to try to end hunger in Africa. A major part of its mission is to uplift the millions of women farmers on the continent."
"Responding to pressure from environmental groups and the requirements of regulators, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and a scientific advisory panel have held public hearings on the risks of atrazine, an agricultural pesticide. It's the most commonly used farm chemical in the U.S. and 90 other countries. Atrazine has been banned by the European Union since 2004, and some studies suggest it may be harmful to human health and the environment."
"The sheep without stumbling descended the plank, which was placed as a gangway to the shore; and the goats, accustomed to steep places, skipped yet more boldly along. Upon reaching the land they all formed in a ring around Chloe, like a chorus of dancers, skipping and bleating and exhibiting every symptom of joy; whereas the flocks of other shepherds remained quiet in the holds of the ships, as if aware that the pipe which sounded was not summoning them."
"For years, supermarkets have offered ready-to-eat salads, sandwiches, pizzas and a variety of other meals in their refrigerated sections. Some supermarkets have now gone a step further, opening cafes, restaurants and in-store kitchens with chefs preparing gourmet specialties. They are taking the advice of marketing experts who follow the latest trends in consumer lifestyles and who closely monitor public concerns about nutrition, health and food safety."
"Research on HCAs has made some people afraid to cook meat on a barbecue grill. On a grill, the meat heats over coals or a gas or open fire. But studies have found that adding spices to meat before cooking at high temperatures may reduce harmful chemicals. This can be done by preparing a marinade and placing it on the meat before cooking. Marinades usually contain spices and herbs added to vinegar, wine or oil. This liquid mixture also softens the meat."
"Physicists who will conduct experiments at the Large Hadron Collider are generally focused on pure research, not practical applications. But as in the past, there are likely to be important spin-offs. Previous discoveries from fundamental science have led to indispensable tools in medicine, industry and research. And then, of course, the World Wide Web was invented at CERN. It was a spin-off from CERN's large research program in information technology."
"The latest national figures show a 30-percent obesity rate among white kids. The figure is five points higher for blacks and eight points higher for Mexican-Americans. Time notes that few blacks, proportionally, live in neighborhoods with well-stocked grocery stores; instead, little corner stores peddle sweets and soft drinks and salty snacks. And fattening foods like tamales and refried beans, cooked in lard, are staples of the Mexican-American diet."
"I look out on the brilliant heaven, and see a milky way of powdery splendour wandering through it, and clusters and knots of stars and planets shining serenely in the blue frosty spaces; and the armed apparition of Orion, his spear pointing away into immeasurable space, gleaming overhead; and the familiar constellation of the Plough dipping down into the west; and I think when I go in again that there is one Christmas the less between me and my grave."
"In short it was only after many failures, and after many barren epochs during which, for a variety of reasons, the enterprise was neglected, that the Fourth Men did at length fashion two individuals almost precisely of the type they had originally designed. These were produced from a single fertilized ovum, in laboratory conditions. Identical twins, but of opposite sexes, they became the Adam and Eve of a new and glorious human species, the Fifth Men."
"A Swiss-born artist who got his first big break in 1955 in the United States, is back in the city of his first museum exhibit, New York. Sculptor, painter, draftsman Alberto Giacometti created most of his masterpieces in a tiny studio in Montparnasse in Paris, but his work has been closely connected with New York. The maestro's work returns to the U.S. this summer, as the Guggenheim Museum welcomes art lovers to an exhibition dedicated to Giacometti."
"An example of citizen science is a project called Project BudBurst. Over the past six growing seasons, Project BudBurst has used thousands of volunteer observers. They record when local plants develop their leaves, flowers and fruit. The observations go into a huge database. Then plant scientists can study the data to look for changes over time. Project director Sandra Henderson says participatory science like this is an idea that is growing quickly."
"Viewers of feature movies on videocassette are long familiar with an FBI warning against unauthorized copying. That warning is being updated and made available for DVDs, music, software and computer games. Many Internet downloads will now also include a version, complete with the FBI seal. The text warns that it is illegal to reproduce or distribute copyrighted material, and infringements are punishable by five years in prison and a fine of $250,000."
"In collecting together, for your use and benefit, some of the prudential maxims, and moral apothegms, of the ancient sages, the Publishers of this volume have been stimulated by an ardent desire to render this excellent mode of instruction as agreeable as possible; and, at the same time, to impress the precepts contained in the Fables more forcibly on your minds, they have endeavoured to make the embellishments worthy of your notice and examination."
"In 1960, Goulet achieved stardom for his role in the Lerner and Loewe musical ""Camelot"", where he starred alongside Richard Burton as King Arthur and Julie Andrews as Queen Guenevere. Goulet played a French knight, Sir Lancelot, who falls in love with Guenevere. His role in ""The Happy Time"" earned Goulet the 1968 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. In 1993, Goulet appeared in a Broadway revival of ""Camelot,"" that time in the role of King Arthur."
"Unlike the definitions that we find in our dictionaries, called denotations, there are different meanings associated with a word that give us more information about it. These are called the connotations of a word. The connotation can tell us if the word is more intense or less intense, if it is positive, pleasing to the speaker, or negative, something that is unpleasant to the speaker. Sometimes these associations can even be emotional or cultural."
"During the summer Chloe had many suitors, who came to Dryas and begged his daughter in marriage. Some brought presents to add weight to their suit, and some made great promises. Nape was elated and advised her husband to marry off Chloe immediately, and not to keep a girl of her age any longer at home, observing that some artful shepherd might entice her whilst she was tending her flocks, and that the best course was to secure a good match for her."
"According to Tom, the theory of evolution by random mutations and natural selection is not convincing for several reasons, the most important of which is the existence of DNA. Among other unacceptable points, Tom adds, this theory claims that the human mind – Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Galileo, Newton, Shakespeare, Descartes, Da Vinci, Mozart, Einstein, Darwin himself – evolved from the mind of an unidentified primate, which would be our ancestor."
"The report, from the World Health Organization and UNICEF, says antenatal care increased by 20 percent among women in the developing world between 1990 and 2000. According to the report, the proportion of women who had at least one antenatal, or pre-birth, visit increased from about half in 1990 to nearly two thirds in 2000. But progress has been uneven. South Asia lags behind, for example, with just over 50 percent of women getting antenatal care."
"The genetic code is a set of instructions in a gene that tells a cell how to make specific proteins, chemicals that are key to an organism's normal development and function. The premature stop codon, which scientists liken to a red stop light, is a mutation that orders cells to stop reading essential genetic instructions part-way through protein synthesis, resulting in an incomplete or shortened protein and potentially serious health consequences."
"It will sometimes grow to a height of fifteen feet, and in swampy places is so dense that it is difficult to keep even a few horses in sight when driving through it; after it dries and the seeds fall to the ground, the stalks break off, and the sweep of the water over the plains during the succeeding year gathers these dry stems against the trees in enormous masses like small haystacks, and there they remain until a bushfire reduces them to ashes."
"Some American businesses have turned to robots or other machines to do manufacturing work once performed by humans. Trade agreements are believed to be another reason for the job loss. Most of these positions no longer exist. That leaves many Americans unemployed or in jobs with low pay and little chance for better wages. At the same time, some companies say they have good-paying jobs but cannot find workers with the skills needed to perform them."
"Once CO₂ is released into the atmosphere, it remains there for decades, while other global-warming pollutants such as methane and black carbon, or soot, do not. Soot is a byproduct of inefficient burning, a big problem in developing countries with cook stoves using wood, dung or coal. Soot stays in the air for only a few days. Methane, a gas released from landfills, farms, mines and natural gas wells, stays in the atmosphere for about a decade."
"Their degrees of consanguinity and alliance are very strange; for being thus akin and allied to one another, we found that none was either father or mother, brother or sister, uncle or aunt, nephew or niece, son-in-law or daughter-in-law, godfather or godmother, to the other; unless, truly, a tall flat-nosed old fellow, who, as I perceived, called a little shitten-arsed girl of three or four years old, father, and the child called him daughter."
"After conducting a great deal of research to keep her recipes on budget, she drew up detailed charts listing the per-serving cost of every ingredient. “It was a lot of work,” Kahn says. “I enjoy it because I enjoy numbers, but your average person is probably not going to do this.” But it helped her come up with meals which were healthy, tasty, filling and cheap. One recent dinner, a potato-zucchini-egg frittata cost about a dollar per serving."
"Amoebic dysentery is a type of diarrheal disease that affects millions around the globe annually. Passed around by contaminated water, amoebas get into people's intestines, causing bloody diarrhea. If left untreated, these single-cell organisms can eventually perforate the intestines, spread throughout the body and kill the host. As Rose Hoban reports, researchers are learning more about the amoeba's ability to outwit the body's immune system."
"The annual great migration of wildlife across Tanzania and Kenya usually attracts thousands of tourists on safari, providing income to people who depend on spending by the visitors — such as souvenir makers. But, as the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed tourism, Kenya's craftsmen and women are suffering. In the city of Narok, women who specialize in beadwork to sell to tourists have seen their incomes drop to a fraction of what they were last year."
"CTPH field station at Bwindi’s tourist site in Buhoma offers animal management training to park rangers and members of the Human/Gorilla Conflict Resolution Team. It includes a group of local people trained by the Uganda Wildlife Authority to chase straying gorillas back to the park. Through a partnership with Makerere University, it also offers computer training to build skills for tourism-related employment and services, such as e-commerce."
"On January 16, 1919, the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibited the “manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes” is ratified. The move came after decades of activism by Americans concerned about the ill effects of alcohol. Prohibition effectively moved the alcohol business into the hands of organized crime, leading to a spike in the crime rate. The 18th Amendment was repealed in 1933."
"Doctor Rosen led a team that studied about twenty healthy people. The team examined the people with functional magnetic resonance imaging devices. MRI’s can show changes in the flow of blood and the amount of oxygen in the blood. They studied the people before, during and after acupuncture. The researchers placed acupuncture needles in the skin on the peoples’ hands. They chose places linked to pain relief in traditional Chinese acupuncture."
"The diminutive Patrick, who stands just one meter, 57 centimeters and weighs 45 kilograms, has been driving for 13 years. She started with go-karts at the age of 10. When she was 16, Patrick moved to England and made her debut in the Formula Vauxhall Winter Series. She continued honing her driving skills, attending the Formula Ford racing school and moving up in the racing world until she signed a multi-year contract with Team Rahal in 2002."
"Tea is the second-most consumed beverage among adults worldwide. Only water is drunk more often. Yet despite its global appeal, tea is not as popular among Americans as coffee is, though that is changing. As new medical studies tout the health benefits of tea consumption, more Americans are giving the ancient drink from China a try. And shops like one called ""Teaism"" in Washington, DC, are also contributing to the drink's growing popularity."
"Gilpin classes these ""Innocent Impostors"" among the most entertaining of his works, and is delighted by the happiness with which he has outdone in their own excellences the artists whom he copied; but Strutt, too grave to admit of jokes that twitch the connoisseurs, declares that they could never have deceived an experienced judge, and reprobates such kinds of ingenuity, played off at the cost of the venerable brotherhood of the cognoscenti."
"Hanim Zainuddin, for instance, usually spends her work hours donning a green sarong and crisscrossing the skies as a flight attendant. After flights were grounded, however, she noticed that more of her coworkers were switching over to health care work, helping in non-medical functions at the hospital. Zainuddin opted to join them, becoming one of 500 aviation workers who made the switch under a state program to adapt work under the pandemic."
"It was a fight down to the wire, but in the end, the tree won. The chestnut tree made famous by Anne Frank in her wartime diary was scheduled to be axed. The ruling follows a protracted battle between the city, which claimed the tree was infested with a fungus and was in imminent danger of falling, and conservationists and neighbors, who argued the tree could be saved. After an emergency court hearing Tuesday, the judge sided with the tree."
"White: rook on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Black: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, bishop on b8. White puts the opponent in zugzwang by playing the rook to a6, after which Black has only two options: take the rook on a6 or move his bishop to any other square on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, White advances his pawn from b6 to b7 and checkmates. In the second situation, the white rook takes the black pawn on a7, with the same result."
"Translators are the sworn enemies of jokes; the exigencies of their deplorable trade cause them to maul the poor little things about while they are putting them into new clothes, and the result is death, or at the least an appearance of vacuous senescence; but jokes are only the crystallization of humour; it exists also in less tangible forms, such as style and all that collection of effects vaguely lumped together and called ""atmosphere."""
"Her hair was the color that lines a chestnut-bur; her eyes were blue in the sunlight and purple in the shade; her cheeks bloomed with the faint pink that edges the clouds at sunset; her lips were full red, pouting and sweet. For costume she adopted oak-leaf green; all the wood-nymphs dress in that color and know no other so desirable. Her dainty feet were sandal-clad, while her head remained bare of covering other than her silken tresses."
"All of today’s nuclear power plants make energy by the splitting of uranium atoms — which creates a lot of useful heat but also a lot of dangerous and deadly nuclear waste. The opposite process — fusion — also creates heat but with hardly any pesky radiation. The problem is that fusion is way more difficult to achieve. Scientists from 35 nations, including the United States, Russia and China, are painstakingly trying to solve the problem."
"How small is a nanometer? Strictly speaking, it's a billionth of a meter. To put things in perspective, comparing a nanometer to a meter is about the same as comparing a marble to the size of the earth. Weckert, a fellow at Canberra's Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics, says the reason ethical issues arise is that scientists and the general public are struggling to understand both the benefits and the risks of nanotechnology."
"Louis Kahn was born in Estonia in nineteen-oh-one. When he was five years old his family moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Even as a child, Louis Kahn showed excellence as an artist. When he was in school his pictures won several competitions organized by the city. In high school, Kahn studied architecture briefly. He later went to the University of Pennsylvania and studied architecture full time. He graduated in nineteen twenty-four."
"Astronomers believe that all galaxies, like our Milky Way, have super-massive black holes at their center, 10,000 to 20,000 times the mass of our sun, acting as nature's vacuum cleaners by sucking everything near them inside. We also know of small black holes created when dying stars collapse inward. Now, the Hubble space telescope has vindicated theorists by finding two of the intermediate variety, about 4,000 times the mass of our sun."
"In September, bison conservationists met at the American Bison Society conference in Banff, Alberta to discuss the social and human dimensions of bison conservation, in addition to other topics including population viability and conservation of federal and tribal herds; concurrently, 15 Native American tribes and First Nations people convened to renew or become new signatories in support of the second anniversary of the Buffalo Treaty."
"The hens range freely here, foraging the ground for extra nutrients. The eggs they lay have big orange yolks. The pigs also get plenty of space indoors and out, and have a wallow to wade in to stave off the summer heat. The cattle feed primarily on grass, not corn as they do in commercial feedlots. And all the animals are fed by hand twice a day, Ms. Lorraine says, so the farmers can keep a close eye on them and make sure they're well."
"In the ""New Deal"" years of the 1930s, President Franklin Roosevelt created a bevy of government agencies that he hoped would pull the nation out of the Great Depression. They produced a nationwide social-security system, farm subsidies, and jobs for struggling workers, who cleared forests, built highways, wrote guidebooks to the states, photographed rural families and dust-blown towns, and created public works of art across the nation."
"For the second year in a row, the World Bank has ranked Singapore as the world's easiest place to do business. Singapore topped the list because of its efficient business procedures, many of which can be done online. New Zealand, Australia and Hong Kong are also among the top 10 business-friendly countries. The World Bank report says that both China and India are making progress in implementing reforms that make business easier there."
"Some 1,500 representatives attending the 30th International Red Cross and Red Crescent Conference have unanimously adopted a resolution that reaffirms the Geneva Conventions guaranteeing certain basic rights and protections for people caught in armed conflict. Lisa Schlein reports for VOA the week-long conference also agreed to tackle the humanitarian consequences resulting from disasters such as climate change and emergent diseases."
"For 21 days in August, more than 10,000 athletes from around the world will compete in the Summer Olympic Games in Beijing. While they come in pursuit of personal dreams, they will also represent their respective countries. For spectators and supporters from the more than 200 countries participating, the Olympics are a chance to cheer for their countrymen and women. For the athletes themselves, national pride is a powerful motivator."
"The operation moves the ileum closer to the pancreas, the organ that makes the insulin we need to process sugar into energy. A digestive hormone in the transposed intestine stimulates the pancreas to secrete more insulin, so diabetics don't need to take it artificially. Ileum transposition also corrects insulin resistance in Type 2 diabetics, according to Erik Wilson, who performs bariatric surgery at the University of Texas Houston."
"It is evident from what has been said, that before 500 A.D. literary chronology, even in the Sanskrit period, is almost entirely relative, priority or posteriority being determined by such criteria as development of style or thought, the mention of earlier authors by name, stray political references as to the Greeks or to some well-known dynasty, and allusions to astronomical facts which cannot have been known before a certain epoch."
"I do not object to your learning English for the sake of acquiring knowledge or for the sake of earning your livelihood but I object to your giving so much importance to English and giving a low place to your national language, Hindi. I do not think it is right on your part to use in your conversation with your friends and relatives any other language than your national language or your mother tongue. Have love for your own language."
"Oyster reefs harbor huge amounts of life. Scores of plants and animals find food and shelter in their nooks and crannies. As the Bay's reefs wore down, that habitat was lost. Further damage came from increasing runoff from coastal farmland, deforestation and development, which silted over the flatter oyster bars, cutting off the creatures' food and dissolved oxygen. Then, in the mid-1900s came the final assault — a pair of parasites."
"American researchers have reported progress in learning how the ancient traditional Chinese method of acupuncture fights pain and other conditions. During acupuncture, very small, sharp needles are placed in the skin at targeted points on the body. Bruce Rosen presented an acupuncture study at a meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society in Orlando, Florida. Doctor Rosen is with the Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts."
"Data from Hubble has allowed astronomers to make cosmic breakthroughs: pin down the age of the universe by measuring the brightness of stars in distant galaxies, watch comets plunge into Jupiter’s clouds, providing new insights into the physics of the stormy planet, and take the very first images of planet-forming disks around newborn stars, something astronomers knew had to be there but never dreamed they’d see with their own eyes."
"Other natural products are also being used in place of plastic. They include the pit, or center, of apricot fruits and the shells of nuts. The pits and shells are ground up and are rough enough to be exfoliants. They — along with jojoba beads — have been used for years by cosmetics manufacturers. So has pumice — a lightweight stone formed by volcanic activity. It has long been used in many kinds of exfoliating and cleaning products."
"Michael Yates remembers recently seeing footage of a South Asian woman who woke up in the middle of the night surrounded by water. She grabbed her children and fled to higher ground, but left everything behind in the flooding, as he recalls. Yates, the director for the U.S. Agency for International Development’s mission in Asia, said that inexpensive tools like early warning systems might have helped this woman minimize her losses."
"Your skin serves as one of the first lines of defense against illness and injury. Its health depends on the balance between your own cells and the millions of microbes—including bacteria, fungi, and viruses—that live on its surface. But during an average day, parts of your skin may brush surfaces in stores, elevators, and restrooms; get nicked by a kitchen knife; be washed with rain; rest on a gym mat; and be slobbered on by a dog."
"Shoes have long since stopped serving only their utilitarian purpose. Over the centuries, shoes have evolved not just to protect feet but also to declare their owners' social status — and sometimes to be worn as treasured objects of art. To honor humanity's sometimes pricey passion for shoes and trace the world's history through footwear, New York's Historical Society has opened a new exhibit, appropriately called, ""Walk This Way."""
"I can speculate all I want about the nature of the universe and ""reality,"" but such would be just speculation. I can say that our reality is like a computer simulation. I can say that our reality is like a hologram. I can say that our reality is like a dream. There are many more I-can-say's. They are speculations. As humans, we are like rabbits in that even if higher beings were to tell us the truth, we still might not understand."
"The post-canonical apocalypses of Judaism fall within the period beginning with the attempt of Antiochus IV to make the Jews Greeks, and the successful resistance of the Maccabees and their establishment of an independent Jewish kingdom, and ending with the Jewish-Roman wars, the destruction of Jerusalem and the suppression by Hadrian of the final Messianic, political uprising under Bar Cochba; that is, from 108 B. C. to 135 A. D."
"The physics of the laser may be complex. Still, it is just a story of how electrons interact with light. When a light particle, or photon, hits an electron, the electron jumps to a higher energy state. If another photon strikes one of these high-energy electrons, the electron releases two photons that travel together at the same wavelength. When this process is repeated enough, lots of organized, or coherent, photons are produced."
"The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in an opinion from its Committee on Obstetric Practice that was published on the ACOG website, said that instead of quickly clamping off the cord that connects the newborn to its placental sac, doctors should wait an additional 30 to 60 seconds. Those extra seconds for babies born at term are associated with an increase in hemoglobin levels in newborns, the statement said."
"Some of the most overlooked diseases around the world are parasitic infections, especially those caused by a kind of parasite called helminths. The group includes hookworms and schistosomes, among others. These worms, which live inside their host, are especially common in developing countries. As we hear from health reporter Rose Hoban, a new study found that if you're infected with one, you're probably infected with others, too."
"Sometimes there was only the width of the road between the imposing precipices on the right and the clear cool water on the left with its shoals of uncatchable fish skimming about through the bars of sun and shadow; and sometimes, in place of the precipices, the grassy land stretched away, in an apparently endless upward slant, and was dotted everywhere with snug little chalets, the peculiarly captivating cottage of Switzerland."
"One noteworthy film from the continent is ""White Lion."" The South African feature documentary by director Michael Swan is in tune with the worldwide movement to save endangered big cats. It tells the story of a rare white lion — a messenger of the gods, in African legend — who faces a challenge greater than the harsh African wilderness: trophy hunters, who value the lion's unique skin far more than they do his legendary mission."
"According to the experts, the cloning procedure involves taking genetic material from a mammal's cell and injecting it into a female egg whose nucleus has been removed. The procedure does not guarantee successful pregnancies or healthy clones and most scientists object cloning humans. Rudolph Jaenisch, a medical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is one of them. For him, the procedure is scientifically unsafe."
"The researchers wondered if they could figure out how to capture that electrical charge as it moved across the membrane separating the fresh and salty water. They did it by creating two tiny membranes, just three atoms thick, made of molybdenum disulfide, which is plentiful and easy to produce. Then they made a tiny hole in the membranes and let osmosis take over and push the electrically charged salt ions through this nanopore."
"Many animal rights activists, who believe non-domesticated species belong in the wild, have condemned so-called ""exotic"" pet ownership. An increasing number of U.S. cities and counties have banned the ownership of certain wild animals, like mountain lions and wolves, for public safety reasons. And the connection between monkeypox and prairie dogs is causing some people to question whether any wild animals should be kept as pets."
"Pre-eclampsia can develop suddenly, usually in the second half of a woman's pregnancy. The condition can lead to a more serious disease called eclampsia that can cause convulsions in pregnant women and result in death of both the mother and child. Researchers at Harvard University and Beth Deaconess Hospital in Boston have identified a marker or substance in the blood that appears to increase the risk of pre-eclampsia in women."
"It is the 26th of February of 2015. Imaginary Visualization is my term for the practice of the mind in which one imagines a vivid, otherworldly scenario. One does it when there is nothing good on TV, no good video to watch, no good magazine to browse, no good book to read, and so on. ""Moss Plain"" is my Imaginary Visualization in which I wander a vast plain, covered by multicoloured moss. The sky is grey. There is a musky smell."
"More than 300 universities across the U.S. are turning green, meaning environmentally oriented. They are building sustainable facilities, renovating buildings, connecting solar and wind systems, planting organic gardens and reducing their overall carbon footprints. They also have initiated academic programs on environmental issues. Experts call it the largest transformation of colleges and universities in the last few decades."
"In yet another instance of an Internet-driven social phenomenon, a growing number of women in the U.S. are joining on-line breast-milk-sharing communities. Their aim is to provide human milk to new mothers who can't breastfeed their babies. While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the potential health risks of this practice, advocates sing the praises of both breast milk and their online community."
"His knowledge of Greek and Latin was singularly exact. He was deeply read in modern literature; and his surprising memory enabled him to display to the utmost advantage the various and carefully stored treasures of his mind. But though his erudition might have enabled him to have edited with accuracy the most obscure work in the whole range of ancient literature, his imagination would not have yielded him five lines of poetry."
"According to the scientific report, published in the online journal Biofabrication, the printed skin has all the essential parts of the natural skin, such as the dermis (the layer of tissue that contains capillaries, nerve endings and other structures), the epidermis (the layer of cells atop the dermis), the stratum corneum (the horny outer layer), and even the collagen, which gives skin its elasticity and mechanical strength."
"Canadian researchers measured the levels of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in the women's blood at 24 weeks of pregnancy, and again one week following delivery. The health of the children was then tracked for five years, the age at which symptoms of asthma, such as wheezing, often first appear. Women who had low levels of omega-3 fatty acids at the start of the study benefitted the most from supplementation, researchers found."
"The Courier published, under a sentimental poetical heading, a detailed description of the rencontre, which, without too violent a departure from the exact truth, yet succeeded in making such a powerful impression on the public mind, and evoked symptoms of such lively interest, that the vigilant newspaper was induced to keep a watchful eye for the future on any further rapprochements between the Spoelmann and Grimmburg houses."
"The world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator will begin operations later this year at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Scientists believe the new atom-smasher, known as the or LHC for short, will help them answer questions about the origin of the universe. The collider is 27 kilometers in circumference, straddling the French-Swiss border near Geneva, buried as deep as 150 meters underground."
"The technology behind seed storage is impressive. Some seeds at the national seed storage lab might remain viable for 600 years. To show me how they could survive so long, Dr. Walters leads me to a room that's relatively warm, though it contains sealed tubs of liquid nitrogen that are 10 times chillier than the big cold storage room. She unseals a cryogenic tub, and when I reach inside, my hands feel surprisingly comfortable."
"DNA testing, the analysis of human biological material, is reshaping America's criminal justice system. Deoxyribonucleic acid is the repository of genetic information that resides in our cells, and no two people — not even identical twins — have the same DNA. In criminal investigations, DNA can be extracted from many sources, a single hair follicle — a drop of blood, other bodily fluids, or a microscopic fingernail scraping."
"All nature joined in rejoicing at the springtide, and Daphnis and Chloe, young and susceptible as they were, imitated whatever they saw or heard. Hearing the carols of the birds, they sang; at sight of the playful skipping of the lambs they danced; and in imitation of the bees they gathered flowers, some of which they placed in their bosoms, whilst with others they wove chaplets which they carried as offerings to the Nymphs."
"But Wolfowitz also pointed to more positive trends. These include the rich nations’ promise to write off 37 billion dollars of African debt and a commitment to double the inflow of assistance to $50 billion a year by 2010. Fifteen Sub-Saharan countries have registered five percent annual growth rates for 10 consecutive years. And the fastest growing economies, Rwanda and Mozambique, have achieved eight percent annual growth."
"Leonardo Da Vinci is known today as a renowned painter, architect, inventor and scientist. Historical accounts say he was also a procrastinator and he never finished a number his projects including his Adoration of the Magi and perhaps even the Mona Lisa. To explain this behavior, a researcher from Kings College, London proposed a new theory — the great Da Vinci may have had Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD."
"Researchers at the University of California San Diego have designed what they’re calling a biobattery in the form of a temporary tattoo. The battery works by “detecting and responding to lactate,” which is found in sweat. When your body needs more energy because of physical exertion, a process called glycolysis occurs. Glycolysis basically turns sugars into usable energy for the body. A byproduct of this process is lactate."
"Climate change has brought dramatic droughts and floods around the world, ruining harvests of important cereal crops and reviving concerns about food security on a warmer planet. Researchers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are looking at cereal crops at risk and their wild, weedy relatives. The weeds are more resilient under extreme conditions, and seem to be benefiting from climate change, while regular crops suffer."
"Few people, we're sure, have ever seen carved eggshells. These have no relationship to eggs that are painted or decorated with gems or other jewels, like Faberge's famous eggs, which weren't even eggs. One artist in the Washington D.C. area is delicately sculpting on eggshells. Her eggshells are seen frequently in local art galleries. Our reporter spent time with Tina Kannapel and her cats — mostly not walking on eggshells."
"Then they planted this garden with all manner fruit-bearing trees and fragrant herbs and flowers and firstlings of every kind and hue and they trained the branches after a wonderful fashion, leading under their shade leats and runnels of cool water; and the boughs were cunningly dispread so as to veil the ground which was planted with grains of divers sorts and greens and all of vegetation that serveth for the food of man."
"The report’s authors — the International Labor Organization, the World Health Organization, the World Bank and WaterAid — say they hope to raise awareness on the plight of sanitation workers and the dehumanizing conditions under which they are forced to work. For example, the report says that many sanitation workers aren’t given the safety training or equipment needed to protect them when handling effluent or fecal sludge."
"The progress realised in the German chemical trade is well known, and it is only too badly felt in Scotland and Northumberland; while the reports on the German iron and steel industries which one finds in the publications of the Iron and Steel Institute and in the inquiry which was made by the British Iron Trade Association show how formidably the production of pig-iron and of finished iron has grown in Germany since 1871."
"And when the chrysanthemums opened their great eyes, and turned their faces upwards to meet the light, they felt quite put about to see those flowers still in bloom. They would have been angry, but it is not in the nature of our garden, or indeed of our wild flora and hedgerow pets, to be so. For flowers are ever meek, albeit they are lovely, and methinks that meekness and beauty, hand in hand, are inexpressibly charming."
Bruno and Shmuel are unlikely friends who might be playmates were it not for the electrified barbed wire fence that separates them. Bruno is the inquisitive son of a rising star in the elite SS corps of Nazi Germany's Third Reich. The father's new assignment takes them from their comfortable Berlin home to a rural farm town where the lonely youngster spots some kids in the distance and asks his mother about visiting them.
"For decades, many naturalists have called for re-classification of the African forest elephant. It is smaller than its free-ranging savannah counterpart. Its tusks are longer, thinner, and straighter, with a suggestion of pink to them. Its skull shape is also different. But appearance alone was insufficient to prove they were a different species, as University of Washington conservation biologist Samuel Wasser points out."
"Before the marathon begins, a computer chip device is attached to each runner’s shoe. It electronically records how long the runner takes to complete the race. Timing begins when a runner passes another device placed across the road at the starting line. The computer chip records each runner’s time as he or she passes over several areas along the race. And it records the runner’s final time when crossing the finish line."
"At the U.S. Department of Agriculture's research center near Washington, D.C., plant physiologist Lewis Ziska said weeds — defined as any unwanted plant — appear to be thriving in today's atmosphere, which is richer in carbon dioxide, or CO₂. And Ziska said agricultural research studies show that if climate trends continue, allergy sufferers will have to endure longer and more intense pollen seasons in the decades ahead."
"New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has campaigned relentlessly against obesity, outlawing transfats in restaurants and forcing chain restaurants to add calorie counts to menus. His latest proposal would ban sugary drinks over 450 grams in the city’s restaurants, movie theaters and other places where large drinks are sold. Some nutritionists say it’s a move in the right direction, but critics say the mayor is going too far."
"The annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the AAAS, in San Francisco back in February, included a standard feature of pretty much any science conference — the poster session. Typically, it's a room full of display panels, with researchers having perhaps three square meters to present the words and pictures that will capture the attention of passersby and succinctly explain their work."
"The two-month course began at the ""Regina Apostolorum,"" one of Rome's prestigious pontifical universities. The course has been described as both ""theoretical and practical"" and is open to priests and theology students only. Teachers include exorcists and psychiatrists. One of the issues that will be addressed is how to tell the difference between someone who is possessed and someone who simply has psychological problems."
"The memories of the days passed in the North are so sunny and delightful, that I wish others to enjoy them with me; and if the reader receives a clear impression of the novel experiences and thorough pleasure attending a journey through Norseland, and partakes, if only in a limited degree, of my enthusiasm over the character of the people and the imposing grandeurs of nature, the object of this book will be accomplished."
"In her book ""Silent Spring,"" Miss Carson questioned the right of industrial companies to pollute without considering the effects on the environment. Miss Carson argued that this kind of pollution would result in ever-decreasing populations of birds and other wildlife. She said this would lead to the loss of the wonderful sounds of nature. The chemical poisoning of the environment, she said, would cause a silent spring."
"The WHO would like to see that same commitment to eliminate the disease in 45 other trachoma-stricken countries. But in many of these countries, trachoma will have to get in line behind other pressing health issues like AIDS, tuberculosis, and meningitis. Morocco has more money to spend on trachoma than many poorer developing countries. And the disease was already on its way out when the current campaign began in 1997."
"The first two weekends of December are the busiest time for selling trees. However, clients are welcome anytime. One Bartlett is always by the phone. On this day, the weather is mild. The firs and pines are waiting for the first customers of the day. Joann Bartlett takes advantage of the lull to create Christmas garlands, talk on the phone, and patiently wait. Her husband Bill arrives just in time for the first buyers."
"Mary is said to have sung so beautifully that, when one day she ventured on to a battlefield, the opposing soldiers dropped their weapons, forgot their enmity and sat down together just to listen to her; the birds are said to have fallen silent; the trees, to have uprooted themselves and moved closer; the stones, they say, rose from the riverbed and mounted the bank, and the wind blew only to carry her melodious voice."
"The Global Seed Vault opened near the North Pole on 26 February, and an Internet project aimed at promoting biodiversity went on line. The so-called ""doomsday"" vault is in the remote Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard and is designed to protect millions of seeds from climate change and other disasters. The Encyclopedia of Life web site is just a click away and is meant as a source of information about all living things."
"Monday was International Day of Democracy and the theme this year was ""Engaging Young People in Democracy."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said that ""powerfully underscores the importance of youth in building and preserving democracy."" He added that ""Democratic societies are strong societies, because people are free to speak out against injustices and to discuss, debate and work together to drive positive change."""
"Through the years, Rosa Parks continued to work for the NAACP and appeared at civil rights events. She was a quiet woman and often seemed uneasy with her fame. But she said that she wanted to help people, especially young people, to make useful lives for themselves and to help others. In nineteen eighty-seven, she founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development to improve the lives of black children."
"Now, however, that they had received the command to rest and sleep (and to gainsay the Father's commands was a thing that would never have entered their minds), they were willing enough to obey, and had hardly laid themselves down before they fell into a deep slumber, from which neither awoke until the light of day had long been shining upon the world, and the Father stood beside them bidding them rise and follow him."
"Architects, engineers and building managers will soon be able to quickly collect data about building interiors that once took weeks to measure and process. A backpack-mounted device, developed by a group of scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, will require just one pass through the building to create not only a 3D model but gather other valuable information related to the building’s energy efficiency."
"Komarova notes that everyone who studies cancer knows that genetic instability (and the mutations it causes) are important for cancer cells: cancer couldn't spread without it. It's not so clear why this mutation rate slows down in later stages of the tumor. She says that this has been observed experimentally, but researchers can't decide whether it's important for cancer growth or if it's just a side-effect of cancer."
"Vietnam’s cuisine is becoming a popular cultural trend in the U.S. as a growing number of Americans acquire a taste for the savory beef soup called pho. The slow-cooked dish might follow the path of Italian pizza, Mexican salsa and Japanese sushi — to be enjoyed across America. As VOA’s Jim Randle reports, President Obama’s planned visit to this former wartime enemy is bringing new attention to all things Vietnamese."
"It is easy to become a Theosophist. Any person of average intellectual capacities, and a leaning toward the metaphysical; of pure, unselfish life, who finds more joy in helping his neighbor than in receiving help himself; one who is ever ready to sacrifice his own pleasures for the sake of other people; and who loves Truth, Goodness, and Wisdom for their own sake, not for the benefit they may confer—is a Theosophist."
"Parmenides wrote about 470 B. C. He is represented as a serious and influential man, with a high moral character. He exercised strong influence upon such philosophers as Plato and Democritus, and was a political power in the city of Elea, of which he was a native. He was not a stranger to the Pythagoreans. The large fragment of his poem is the most ancient monument extant of metaphysical speculation among the Greeks."
"Australia's vast native forests are storing three times as much carbon as previously thought and could hold the key to tackling climate change, according to a new study released Tuesday. It has found the eucalyptus forests of southeast Australia can harness billions of metric tons of greenhouse gases and the clearing of such forests threatens to significantly increase the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere."
"The trial, reported in the journal The Lancet, took place in June 2015. None of the participants had received a flu vaccine during the previous influenza season. The participants were divided into four groups. In one group the patch was administered by a health care provider, in the second it was self-administered by each participant, a third group received the vaccine via injection and a fourth group got a placebo."
"It’s no longer news that on April 20th, the catastrophic explosion of an offshore rig sent an undersea gusher of oil boiling to the surface of the Gulf of Mexico off Louisiana. Or that winds, tides and time have overwhelmed efforts to contain a slick the size of Cyprus, spreading globs of emulsified goo to the very edges of the tender marshes and bayous of Plaquemines Parish, and onto the barrier Chandeleur Islands."
"More than 50 million people in the United States suffer from allergies, and their numbers are growing. New studies suggest that climate change may be at least partly to blame. Scientists say rising average temperatures and elevated levels of carbon dioxide are spurring the growth of many weedy, allergenic plants — such as ragweed — and extending the season of suffering for pollen-sensitive people across the country."
"It’s estimated that just 10 to 12 percent of the human population is left-handed. Across cultures and over the years, left-handed people have been described as sinister, evil, crooked and the like. But in modern, more tolerant societies, the lefty seems to thrive. A University of London scholar even wrote that left-handed people produce an above-average quota of high achievers. What does it mean to be a lefty today?"
"They identify methane, tropospheric ozone, hydrofluorocarbons and black carbon as pollutants that could be targeted, with technologies that already exist, to drastically cut their release. Quickly implementing that strategy could off-set warming temperatures by up to 50 percent by 2050, and reduce sea level rise by 22 to 42 percent by the end of the century. Delaying emission cuts would reduce the beneficial impact."
"Scientists have learned how aspirin interferes with a protein enzyme. One form of the enzyme makes the prostaglandin that causes pain and swelling. Another form of the enzyme creates the protective kind of compound. So, while aspirin can reduce pain and swelling in damaged tissues, it also can harm the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Still, aspirin does things that other drugs for treating pain cannot do."
"He knew that Mr. Welland, who was behaving ""very handsomely,"" already had his eye on a newly built house in East Thirty-ninth Street. The neighbourhood was thought remote, and the house was built in a ghastly greenish-yellow stone that the younger architects were beginning to employ as a protest against the brownstone of which the uniform hue coated New York like a cold chocolate sauce; but the plumbing was perfect."
"The intruder did not answer—did not even seem to hear her question. He remained literally as if turned to stone, his eyes burning cavernously in his pale face, on which the upcast light of the lantern at his feet, crossing with that of Valentine’s lamp, cast odd shadows. After a moment, moving like a man half stunned from a fall, he came a little towards her. Then he stopped again, and passed his hand over his eyes."
"The holiday season that begins Thursday with Thanksgiving Day feasts in many American homes is often the only time of year that people pay much attention to the homeless and hungry. We buy someone a meal, slip a panhandler a buck or two, or spend a day volunteering at a soup kitchen. But a new newspaper in Washington, D.C., aims to put a human face on homelessness year-round, not just during the frigid months ahead."
"The free access which many young people have to romances, novels, and plays has poisoned the mind and corrupted the morals of many a promising youth; and prevented others from improving their minds in useful knowledge. Parents take care to feed their children with wholesome diet; and yet how unconcerned about the provision for the mind, whether they are furnished with salutary food, or with trash, chaff, or poison?"
"On the eighteenth day out from Sydney, we were cruising under the lee of Erromango—of course you know Erromango, an isolated island between the New Hebrides and the Loyalty group—when suddenly our dusky Polynesian boy, Nassaline, who was at the masthead on the lookout, gave a surprised cry of ""Boat ahoy!"" and pointed with his skinny black finger to a dark dot away southward on the horizon, in the direction of Fiji."
"The United Nations estimates that each one of us uses nearly 140 kilograms of plastic each year. At least 6.4 million metric tons of that plastic has ended up in the oceans. Environmental activist Captain Charles Moore has found that in some areas, plastic outweighs zooplankton — the ocean's food base — and is entering the food chain. Our reporter talked to Capt. Moore about his efforts to document ocean pollution."
"A boy who, on his way from one classroom to another, from the dayroom to the cricket field, and the library to the chapel, has always before him the silent grey-brown witnesses of continuity and tradition, cannot help thinking often consciously, and unconsciously times without number: “all this was going on two hundred years ago and, without any very considerable alteration, it will be going on two hundred hence.”"
"The term ""ballistics"" refers to the study of a projectile in motion. Ballistics also refers to the forensic study of bullets, cartridges and firearms in criminal investigations. When a bullet travels through a gun barrel, the bullet's metal gets worn in a unique pattern by the harder metal of the barrel. Unless there has been some intentional alteration, any bullet fired by a specific gun will show the same marks."
"Bob, too, was indefatigable in his exertions in my behalf; now ranging the woods with his airgun, in search of a species of pigeon which he had discovered; anon going away in the canoe (in which Ella had escaped, and which he had contrived to retain) to the rocks, and bringing in sundry delicately-flavoured fish; and then off to the woods again for fruit, of which the island afforded any quantity of various kinds."
"A quilted work by artist Linda Gass hangs in the entrance of the exhibit. Rebecca Stevens organized the exhibit. She says the work brings together the many subjects in the exhibit. To create the work “Treatment?,” Ms. Gass used cloth and paints to create an image of a water treatment center on the San Francisco Bay. The brightly colored cloth image looks like a photograph of land and river taken from an airplane."
"Both sulforaphane and metformin reduce glucose production by the liver, through a mechanism the body uses to ensure it has enough fuel during periods of fasting, like overnight. In diabetics who are also overweight, Rosengren said, the liver's glucose production function is not sensitive to the body's needs, and the liver dumps too much glucose into the bloodstream, causing unhealthy spikes in blood sugar levels."
"The farmer grew carrots, cabbage, onions and beetroot. But he found that potatoes grew better than the other vegetables in the combination of sea and fresh water. Mr. Van Rijsselberghe says four kinds of these potatoes were recently sent to Pakistan, where thousands of hectares of land have been damaged by salinization. Farmers in Pakistan will test the Dutch potatoes to see if they can be grown in those fields."
"An older building may need a new, more efficient heating and cooling system. Experts say the first thing you need to know is the exact shape of all rooms in the building. You have to consider the size and position of heating and cooling equipment, windows and doors. Another consideration is the placement of electrical outlets — the areas where electrically-operated equipment can be connected to the power supply."
"Tribal nomads from Iran to Mongolia provided supplies and transportation for the Silk Road traders. Nomads do not live in settlements. They move from place to place with their animals. On the Mall next month, camels will carry nomad houses called yurts which are easily transported from place to place. And a Pakistani truck painted in bright colors will demonstrate that travel continues along the Silk Road today."
"Because it does not need refrigeration, Rouphael said the patch could be bought off a store shelf or mailed to patients. The fact that it is painless, said Rouphael, means more people are likely to get vaccinated against the seasonal flu virus. The patch’s manufacturer, Global Center for Medical Innovation in Atlanta, is investigating using the device for other vaccines, including for measles, mumps and rubella."
"The beams that are injected into the LHC will travel through a vacuum guided by superconducting magnets operating at extremely cold temperatures near absolute zero. Each beam will consist of nearly 3,000 bunches, with each bunch containing as many as 100 billion particles. When head-on collisions occur, they will produce a shower of new particles. But the most interesting new particles will be very rare events."
"Marty Knowlton and co-founder David Bianco eventually combined those two concepts to create Elderhostel. Over the years, the basic idea has remained the same. Enrollment costs are affordable, and accommodations often in college dormitories or local hotels are comfortable but not luxurious. There have been innovations as well, however, including intergenerational programs for the elderly and their grandchildren."
"Everyone is familiar with the fact that pumice floats upon water; this it does, not because it is a material specifically lighter than water, but because cavities filled with air make up a great part of its bulk. If we pulverise pumice, we find the powder sinks readily in water, but the rock in its natural condition floats for the same reason that an iron ship does—because of the air-chambers which it encloses."
"NOAA scientists describe coral reefs as the ""rainforests of the sea,"" noting that these fragile marine ecosystems provide important services such as coastal protection, commercial fish habitats and ecotourism, estimated to be worth as much as $375 billion globally each year. And if predictions are right, the coral reefs will survive, at least for another year, to share these benefits with the world around them."
"The custard apple tree is often found in sandy and loamy soils throughout much of tropical Africa but can tolerate some of the cold of parts of subtropical South Africa. According to the US National Research Council, which includes the tree in its series of publications called Lost Crops of Africa, the custard apple grows best in warm and fairly moist conditions, especially in mixed woodlands and open savannas."
"A hundred years after their discovery, the artifacts from Egyptian prehistoric mausoleums will return close to the place where they were found. A huge new museum overlooking the Giza pyramids in Egypt is due to open some of its sections early next year. The exhibit devoted to pharaoh Tutankhamun, known to archeologists as the Golden Boy and in popular culture as King Tut, is expected to draw the most attention."
"He told us that the train had been robbed of its gold bricks, by five men, three of whom, dressed like Indians, rifled the baggage car while the others held the passengers at bay; that the engine was hopelessly wrecked, the engineer killed; that the robbers had escaped on horseback with their booty; and that men had been sent to the nearest telegraph station to “wire” for another engine and a supply of workmen."
"Electronic cigarettes, mostly made in China, first appeared in the United States a couple of years ago, and they're no longer a novelty. An estimated one-half-million Americans, especially those who are trying to kick the smoking habit, have switched to them. The federal government, which heavily regulates tobacco products, wants to oversee e-cigarettes as well. But their makers are fighting hard to prevent it."
"It was a bright sunny morning, every leaf sparkling with dew-drops; groups of neatly-dressed people were to be seen flocking in from the country in every direction; and though the air was fresh enough to incline them to walk briskly along, their hands were not hidden away in muffs and coat-pockets, but were ready for the friendly shake which, with ""all the good wishes of the season,"" awaited them at every step."
"If adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy (and there is no evidence of a risk in later trimesters), the labeling shall state: ""Studies in pregnant women have not shown that (name of drug) increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during the first (second, third, or all) trimester(s) of pregnancy."""
"Determined attempts were made both openly and by stealth to strangle the system at its birth, to destroy the mustard seed at the time of the planting; and, as the fact of its survival has become prominent the certainty of its impending demise has been announced time and again; the fall of the umbrageous tree, amidst whose branches the birds of search continue to find food and shelter, has been often predicted."
"Inside the plane, half a dozen scientists are fine-tuning 10 kinds of weather sensors, including microwave and laser. They stay on board, monitoring their instruments, as pilots fly over pre-selected snowy mountains, and high, snowy mesas. They’re seeking accurate snow measurements, even when craggy peaks mean snow is at different levels in the peaks and the valleys. Even when trees and forests hide the snow."
"In the Seventeen-Hundreds, people used willow bark to reduce a sick person's high body temperature. In Eighteen-Sixty, researchers at the Bayer Company in Germany copied the salicylic acid found in willow bark. They created acetyl salicylic acid. They called it aspirin, for the spirea plant which also contains the natural chemical. Aspirin first was made into its present pill form about one-hundred years ago."
"Scientists at the LIGO and VIRGO observatories detected and confirmed the first gravitational waves produced by the collision and merger of a black hole with a neutron star, not once but twice within 10 days of each other. Previously confirmed gravitational wave detections were the results of either the collisions of a black hole and another black hole or a neutron star with a neutron star, not one of each."
"One of the most destructive invasive species in North America's Great Lakes was also the first one to arrive. The sea lamprey invaded the Lakes more than a hundred years ago, and in all that time, no one's been able to get rid of it. It's the only invader in the Lakes that managers have been able to control, but it takes millions of taxpayers' dollars every year to keep the blood-sucking parasite in check."
"Anne reveled in the world of color about her. ""Oh, Marilla,"" she exclaimed one Saturday morning, coming dancing in with her arms full of gorgeous boughs, ""I'm so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers. It would be terrible if we just skipped from September to November, wouldn't it? Look at these maple branches. Don't they give you a thrill—several thrills? I'm going to decorate my room with them."""
"Milton Berle was known for his work with non-profit groups. He performed for soldiers during World War Two. He appeared in thousands of shows that helped to raise money for different kinds of organizations. In nineteen forty-nine, he helped to organize a television show for the Damon Runyon Memorial Cancer Fund. It may have been the first time that television was used to raise money for a non-profit group."
"But the numismatist has none of those aids which the geologist derives from the order of superposition, and the mineral characters of the rocks in which his fossils are preserved; and, in the case of uninscribed coins, has nothing but the type and its geographical range on which to found any conclusion, unless, as in some rare instances it happens, the coins are associated with others of more certain date."
"Astronomers say they have found definitive evidence that White Dwarf stars form crystal cores made of metallic oxygen and carbon. A white dwarf is a star that is in its final phase of dying before becoming a black dwarf, a cold and lifeless hunk of rock, trillions of years later. Scientists expect that, in about 10 billion years, our own Sun will also become a white dwarf and then later a black dwarf star."
"Every February, I, along with many others across the nation, commemorate Black History Month and celebrate an important aspect of my diverse cultural heritage. Like most Americans, I’m the sum of many parts, an amalgam of intersecting identities. I am Black, a woman and a proud disabled veteran, to name a few. The intersectionality of my heritage and lived experiences is unique to me and makes me who I am."
"Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul."
"It should not be a surprise that composites are such an important part of the park's flora, as they are reputed to be one of the largest families of plants with about 1,100 genera and 20,000 species. This family is unusual in that it reaches its greatest diversity in open, temperate areas such as prairie and steppe habitats rather than in tropical forests where many other plant families are most diverse."
"After the capture of Syracuse by the Romans, silver, the foundation of the treasure they had seized, fell suddenly in price, so that seventeen pounds of silver were valued at one of gold. A little later the relative price was as 12 to 1, when Caesar, having plundered the two milliards contained in the public chest, so reduced the value of gold, which then predominated, that the proportion fell to 9 to 1."
"She had 102 loyal clients who paid an average of $150 for extensions, braiding, haircuts and other salon services. Like many small-business owners, she is struggling now to pay the rent, other business expenses and her home mortgage, and to put food on the table for her two children, a 13-year-old daughter named Zeal and a 2-year-old son, Zion. The single mom also has two employees she’s concerned about."
"In this follow-up study, Tucker and her colleagues recruited men whose average age was about 75 years old. Over a period of four years, the researchers used a bone scanner to make regular measurements of the men's hips, spines and forearms. Tucker also had the men keep detailed information about what they ate. In particular, she asked about vitamin C, because vitamin C seems to slow down bone resorption."
"Some drug companies say they do meet ethical standards. For instance, the U.S.-based Pfizer company has its own guidelines. They include allowing independent ethics institutions to validate the process before the trials begin and obtaining informed consent from trial subjects. They also call for limiting risks as much as possible and guaranteeing healthcare for participants who emerge with complications."
"Fontana says people on the low-calorie diet had hearts that looked 15 years younger compared with the control group that did not curb their appetites. But he says simply cutting calories isn't the formula for a healthier heart. It is paying attention to what you eat. ""Calorie restriction does not mean eating half a hamburger, half a pack of French fries and half a glass of one of these sugary beverages."""
"But there'll be no more deliveries for Dr. Trietsch. As of January 1, he is no longer doing obstetrics and is focusing instead on gynecology. Dr. Trietsch says it was a difficult decision. It's not that's he's tired of being on call nights, weekends, and holidays. It's that his malpractice insurance premium is tripling, from $28,000 to about $90,000 a year. The cost was simply too much for his practice."
"The best records of childhood cancers were from Western countries, including the United States, which kept records on almost 100 percent of sick children. Five percent or less of the data came from Africa and Asia, according to the report. In those low resource settings, Steliarova-Foucher says many cancers may go undiagnosed because of a lack of awareness and the unavailability of diagnostic equipment."
"Cities or farms? As water gets tighter, everyone who depends on the Colorado River will have to decide what is most valuable. But there’s one silent stakeholder that’s been ignored for most of the last century. As humanity has tapped the river to the limit, there is a growing recognition of the devastation inflicted on natural ecosystems. And there are indications that attitudes are beginning to change."
"Marjorie saw Leonard before he saw her. He was walking with three men—joking, laughing absent-mindedly, while his eyes searched for a face in the crowd. She waited a moment, hidden, suffocated with anticipation, her heart turning over and over, until he said a nonchalant good-bye to his companions, who were pounced upon by eager relatives. Then she crept up behind and put both her hands about his wrist."
"At last he clasped his hands in prayer, and in so doing rubbed the ring, which the magician had forgotten to take from him. Immediately an enormous and frightful genie rose out of the earth, saying: “What wouldst thou with me? I am the Slave of the Ring, and will obey thee in all things.” Aladdin fearlessly replied: “Deliver me from this place!” whereupon the earth opened, and he found himself outside."
"So the road toward equality of freedom is not easy, and great cost and danger march alongside us. We are committed to peaceful and nonviolent change, and that is important for all to understand though all change is unsettling. Still, even in the turbulence of protest and struggle is greater hope for the future, as men learn to claim and achieve for themselves the rights formerly petitioned from others."
"The meeting was extremely interesting even to the non-Esperantic mind, as illustrating the practicability of Esperanto as an international medium of expression; for here one heard ladies and gentlemen from various countries, having little or no knowledge of each others language, clearly and fluently expressing their ideas in a public building, and being evidently promptly understood by those listening."
"The thrushes are largely insectivorous, and also are fond of spiders, myriapods, sowbugs, snails, and angleworms. The vegetable portion of their diet consists mostly of berries and other small fruits. As a family thrushes can not be called clean feeders, for the food eaten often contains a considerable proportion of such matter as dead leaves, stems, and other parts of more or less decayed vegetation."
"Peavey and her husband run one of the oldest sheep ranches in this part of Idaho. They decided to become proactive, to share their heritage with the recreationists, the vacation home owners and other new arrivals. Now every fall, one of the local sheep ranching families trails their flock right through the center of the resort town. It's turned into an annual festival called the Trailing of the Sheep."
Fans of the venerable X-Men comic books (and there are millions around the world) know Wolverine as the most charismatic and enigmatic of the 'mutants' who each have unusual powers. He himself is fuzzy on the details of where he came from: how John Logan became Wolverine with amazing strength and a skeleton of the indestructible metal 'adamantium.' This new film goes back to fill in that origin story.
The French Ministry of Culture has recently conferred the prestigious distinction of Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters on the acclaimed mezzo-soprano for her interpretation of French music. Another American recognized for his work with French music is conductor and musicologist William Christi. His efforts have led to a renewed appreciation of 17th and 18th-century French Baroque repertoire.
"Now, to ease thy woes, / since sorrow for his sake hath dimmed thine eyes, / more will I tell, and hidden fates disclose. / He in Italia long shall battle with his foes, / and crush fierce tribes, and milder ways ordain, / and cities build and wield the Latin sway, / till the third summer shall have seen him reign, / and three long winter-seasons passed away / since fierce Rutulia did his arms obey."
"Salmonella is a potentially deadly food-borne bacterium that plagues millions of people each year, making them sick with fever, stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhea. But infection with salmonella does not just induce misery. The World Health Organization says salmonellosis — and the dehydration that comes with it — leads to thousands of deaths annually, with the very young and elderly most at risk."
"The album, “Thriller”, was as much about moves as it was about music. Michael Jackson brought attention to his body’s movements by wearing a shiny white glove, shortened black pants, and white socks. He created revolutionary dance movements that were electrifying. He could be as hard as a robot, or as smooth as liquid. While doing his famous “Moonwalk” step, he seemed to be walking backwards on air."
"In now reprinting the two, as one, it has not been difficult to give continuity to the whole: this has been effected, partly by removing from each volume portions which seemed to be of secondary importance, and to be not closely related to the principal intention of the work; and partly by introducing several entire chapters of new material; and by the insertion of additional paragraphs throughout."
"It’s not precisely clear why a 16th-century German cartographer chose to honor the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci by naming a land mass after him instead of Christopher Columbus, who historically gets the credit for America’s discovery. VOA’s Ardita Dunellari reports Martin Waldseemuller’s 1507 map has been called America’s birth certificate as the first geographic document to apply the moniker."
"The sum of the ignorance of the Republican candidates in the primaries for the U.S. presidential election is simply mind-boggling: one is afraid that China will obtain nuclear weapons, which they have had for 44 years, and the other proposes to close the U.S. embassy in Iran, which has been closed for 32 years... Such stupidity at the head of the world's most powerful country gives one the shivers!"
"The Sirens would appear to have been personifications of those numerous rocks and unseen dangers, which abound on the S.W. coast of Italy. They were sea-nymphs, with the upper part of the body that of a maiden and the lower that of a sea-bird, having wings attached to their shoulders, and were endowed with such wonderful voices, that their sweet songs are said to have lured mariners to destruction."
"Cris’ comment coming through my high definition tv made me think if it was still true that “you had to be there.” Comparing what I saw in “real definition,” I can attest watching on modern television is in many ways better. The close up perspectives, sweeping panoramic shots, super slow motion replays all display the action as you could never see it from a stadium seat or standing on the sidelines."
"He attempted his door; it was locked on the outside; and his perplexity and anxiety became extreme, when suddenly the lock was turned, and in an underdress, hastily assumed in the moment of alarm, her hair streaming on her shoulders, her eyes gleaming betwixt fear and resolution, Alice Bridgenorth rushed into his apartment, and seized his hand with the fervent exclamation, “Julian, save my father!”"
"When she came back she had hundreds of things to tell them, but the most delightful of all, she said, was to lie in the moonlight, on a sandbank in a calm sea, and to gaze at the large town close to the shore, where the lights twinkled like hundreds of stars; to listen to music and the noise and bustle of carriages and people, to see the many church towers and spires, and to hear the bells ringing."
"The LHC is expected to produce frontier physics for about 10 years. But scientists already are discussing the next generation of accelerator to be built. The scientific community generally agrees the LHC's successor will be a giant linear electron-positron collider, about 30 kilometers in length. Competition among CERN, the United States and Japan to win the rights to build the machine is intense."
"Researchers divided 83 individuals with Type 2 diabetes into three groups. Two of the groups received intensive metabolic intervention that included a personalized meal plan that cut their daily caloric intake by 500 to 750 calories per day. They were also given an individualized exercise plan, met with a dietitian regularly and took medication and insulin at bedtime to help control blood glucose."
"The river cuts through the dry Chihuahuan Desert. Big Bend National Park contains the northernmost part of this desert. It is the second-largest desert in North America. Much of the desert is south of the border in Mexico. The Rio Grande serves as an international border between the United States and Mexico for about 1,600 kilometers. The park itself shares a border with Mexico for 189 kilometers."
"Using the algebraic notation system, each square on the board is identified by a letter and a number. The letters – from “a” to “h”, left to right of white's player – correspond to the vertical lines (columns). The numbers – from 1 to 8, also from the position of white – correspond to the horizontal lines (rows). For example, a checker on c5 is in the encounter of the 3rd column with the 5th row."
"During the reigns of Charles II., and James, his successor, the principal nobility held frequent meetings in a subterraneous vault beneath this house, for the purpose of ascertaining the measures necessary to be pursued for reestablishing the liberties of the kingdom, which the insidious hypocrisy of one monarch, and the more avowed despotism of the other, had completely undermined and destroyed."
"One of the most popular art exhibits in Chicago this year has been on display for more than 10 months in what had been one of the city's least-visited cultural facilities. An exhibit of handmade glass works by world-renowned artist Dale Chihuly has attracted several hundred thousand people, is helping renovate a century-old conservatory and might help change the image of one Chicago neighborhood."
"Boaz answered her, ""I have been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father, your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn’t know before. May the Lord repay your work, and a full reward be given to you from the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge."""
"This study involved nearly 2,400 adults. Almost 11 percent of them identified themselves as regular aspirin users. Eye tests were performed after five, 10 and 15 years. The researchers found that aspirin takers had twice the risk of neovascular, or “wet,” AMD in comparison to non-regular aspirin users. The findings were reported in December 2012 in the Journal of the American Medical Association."
"The Sultan's Palace and the ancient Hippodrome are also places of great interest. In the latter were deposited the four gilded bronze horses, supposed to have been brought from Scio, once mounted on Trajan's Arch at Rome, brought here by Constantine. They were taken to Venice by Dandolo, then Napoleon gave them to Paris, and finally after Waterloo they were restored again to St. Mark's at Venice."
"Of two balls of the same size (one made of iron, the other of wood) falling from the top of a tower, the iron one, because it has a greater gravitational charge (being heavier), is attracted with greater force, but, on the other hand, precisely because it has more mass (inertia), it offers greater resistance to falling. The result: both touch the ground at the same time, as Galileo demonstrated."
"Tom Cruise’s latest Mission Impossible movie features strong women, mind-bending theatrics and powerful visuals. The franchise’s secret weapon is Cruise himself, who performs his own jaw-dropping stunts, including skydiving from 27,000 feet above ground and falling vertically from a helicopter that the actor himself is piloting. VOA asks the 56-year-old superstar how long he plans to keep at it."
"Antibiotic resistance, in which microbes no longer respond to drugs, is quickly becoming a global health emergency. Of particular concern are so-called “superbugs,” a handful of pathogens that patients acquire in hospitals and other health care settings. Patients recovering from surgery are particularly vulnerable to the resistant, hospital-borne infections, which put them at high risk of death."
"Researchers at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland and Harvard University in Boston said in June that they had developed two vaccines against Zika that protected mice. Since then, a third vaccine, using a harmless cold virus, has been developed, and all of them shielded nonhuman primates against the mosquito-borne virus in experiments reported this week in the journal Science."
"Each year, the National Archives organizes events marking the Fourth of July, the birthday of the United States of America. This year, the National Archives prepared an especially fitting exhibition. Entitled “Amending America,” it is a story about thousands of failed attempts to change the U.S. Constitution, a succinct body of fundamental principles and precedents by which America is governed."
"Syndromes are often named after the physician or group of physicians who discovered them or initially described the full clinical picture. Such eponymous syndrome names are examples of medical eponyms. Recently, there has been a shift towards naming conditions descriptively (by symptoms or underlying cause) rather than eponymously, but the eponymous syndrome names often persist in common usage."
"He recalls the early days of the outbreak, saying ""more and more patients were admitted to my ICU. Among all those patients there were many health care professionals. There were nurses, there were doctors, there were occupational therapists, a radiographer and some assistants. When the number of health care workers increased we also felt worried. We might bring this disease back to our family."""
"It isn't just its trifling value that has prompted the U.S. Congress to seriously consider doing away with the penny coin. For the first time, it now costs MORE than a penny to make one! The thinking goes that if we stop circulating pennies, all the prices and add-on taxes can be rounded to the nearest NICKEL. We won't need to fish in our pockets or purses for those annoying pennies any longer."
"The U.S. Botanic Garden in Washington is a living plant museum, filled with the colors and scents of some 65,000 plants. In its greenhouse and outdoor gardens are orchids, cacti and succulents, carnivorous plants, bromeliads, cycads and ferns. And for much of this year, more than 75 paintings, photographs and illustrations showcasing key flora from America's national parks are on display, too."
"Since the introduction of the process of gas-singeing in finishing textiles, many improvements have been made in the construction of the machines for this purpose as well as in that of the burners, for the object of the latter must be to effect the singeing not only evenly and thoroughly, but at the same time with a complete combustion of the gas and avoidance of sooty deposits upon the cloth."
We spend virtually no concerted time or effort honing our intellectual fitness. Yet the study suggests that daily mental drills will have a lot more impact on our longevity and wellbeing than abdominal crunches and boring hours on the treadmill. The brainpower exercises we complete today can improve our mental agility as far as five years into the future. No workout at the gym can match that.
"In the meantime, people still need electricity — and lots of it. According to the International Energy Agency, between now and the year 2050, the global demand for energy will triple, requiring an investment of about $350 trillion in energy infrastructure. How much of a role, if any, nuclear power will play is a question whose answer may lie in the smouldering ruins of the Fukushima reactors."
"For example, because U.S. commercial apple trees are often felled by diseases like ""fire blight"" and ""apple scab,"" Forsline and his team have made several field trips to the forests of Kazakhstan, where the apple originated, to collect wild apple seeds. Because this fungal disease co-exists with ancient wild apple trees, Forsline concludes that the trees have evolved genetic resistance to it."
"The dog padded silently through tall, wild grass growing beside the creek. He drooled at the odor of food, but because painful experience had taught him to be very careful in all dealings with men, he did not go any nearer. He licked his chops with a moist tongue and excitement danced in his eyes. How he would love to be near that fire, partaking of the food and the caresses of the young man!"
"Obstfeld and his colleagues are also worried that efforts to stimulate economic recovery from the 2008 recession, such as low interest rates and massive purchases of bonds, are now ending. They put the current global growth rate at 2.9 percent, and say this moment of good growth is the time to make changes in tax and other policies that will help economies weather inevitable future downturns."
"Chief among them, says Buchanan, is melatonin, a hormone stimulated by darkness to play a key role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle and cell division. Scientists say reduced melatonin production is a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers, and they propose that modern night lighting contributes to the larger incidence of some cancers in the industrial world."
"During his lecture, Dr. Alemseged talked about human evolution through his experiences, fieldwork and research. About four hundred people attended the lecture. Among his current works are descriptions of new hominine and non-human primate fossils; growth and development in early hominines; and analysis of environmental and ecological factors affecting primate and human evolutionary processes."
"Trachoma strikes hardest in remote places like these. Water for washing faces is scarce, and medical care is far away. Trachoma begins as a bacterial eye infection. If left untreated, the infection scars the eyelid, turning the eyelashes inward. The lashes rub painfully up against the eyeball with every blink. Over time, the rubbing scars the cornea, clouding vision and leading to blindness."
"NASA's $19 billion proposed budget for 2011 reflects a more than a quarter-billion-dollar increase over this year's spending, with an additional $6 billion investment in science, aeronautics and spaceflight technologies during the next five years. It represents a shift toward greater investment in science, research and development that could lead to technological and aeronautic advancements."
"Many millions of people around the world suffer from problems of the small intestine. Bleeding from abnormal growths and other disorders affect an estimated nineteen-million people in the United States alone. But the problems have been difficult to identify because it is hard for doctors to examine this organ. Now, however, a new device is giving doctors a better look at the small intestine."
"Hunter's partner in the dark skies group, astronomer David Crawford, says the organization is working with industry to improve lighting. He cites technological advances such as light-emitting diodes, the kind of light used in cellphones. They run cool and save energy, but can also be night-friendly because they project light only where directed, not in all directions like incandescent bulbs."
"That is Kevin Hand, a planetary scientist and astrobiologist who works at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. This lab works with the American space agency on projects including looking for life in outer space. Kevin Hand is assisting with plans to send an orbital device to Europa, a moon of the planet Jupiter. Space agency officials hope to launch the device in about twenty-twenty."
"Her grant of nearly $900,000 allows her to hire graduate students for research into how plankton can adapt to changes in salinity and temperature. Her two targets are witnessing diametrically opposite climate-affected impacts; while the Mediterranean is increasing in salinity, ice melt is injecting a mass of freshwater into the Baltic Sea that promises to decimate key local species like cod."
All of Kahn’s buildings share a common solidity and heaviness. Experts say they are very different from the works of other famous architects of the period. These architects preferred light and airy buildings. Their weightless-looking structures were mostly made of glass and metal. Kahn used stone and concrete to make monumental buildings. Many of his structures look more ancient than modern.
"More than a half-million women in developing countries die each year during childbirth. But a study shows an inexpensive drug could prevent a leading cause of those deaths. The conclusion is based on a study of 10,000 pregnant women. Up to eight percent of pregnant women around the world develop a condition called pre-eclampsia which is marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine."
"Roughly 253 scientists from 21 countries worked for five years to decipher the genetic blueprints of the single-cell parasites that cause sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. Experts say the disease-causing protozoa, which affect 500 million people in the tropics and sub-tropics at any one time, look identical under the microscope, but are spread by different flying insects."
"The members of the band called El Street Cafe have been playing together for four years. The band's rousing mixture of blues and bluegrass usually attracts a big crowd. Passersby stop to listen to a song or two. Sometimes they may even sing along. Lester Schultz, the lead singer and harmonica player of El Street Cafe, says subway musicians are part of an important tradition of public music."
"Orthography is less essential to language than orthoepy; since all languages are spoken, whilst but a few languages are written. Orthography presupposes orthoepy. Orthography addresses itself to the eye, orthoepy to the ear. Orthoepy deals with the articulate sounds that constitute syllables and words; orthography treats of the signs by which such articulate sounds are expressed in writing."
"The US government is considering, for the first time, the approval of a genetically-modified animal for human consumption. The animal being considered is salmon, but approval could open the door for other animals as well. Those who favor the move say it would help feed the world's rapidly-growing population at a time that depleted rivers and oceans are becoming unable to fulfill the demand."
"Nevertheless, while their doings were not recognized officially by the government, the perpetrators were neither punished nor reprimanded for their excursions against Spanish commerce at home or in the West Indies; rather were they commended, and it was considered not altogether a discreditable thing for men to get rich upon the spoils taken from Spanish galleons in times of nominal peace."
"Researchers with the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater, Maryland, studied the impact of rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere — one byproduct of carbon-rich industrial emissions — on the larvae of two closely-related oyster species — Eastern oysters, which are indigenous to the Atlantic coast of the United States, and Suminoe oysters, which are native to Asia."
"The people in M.C. Escher's lithograph, ""Ascending and Descending"", seem to climb up and up a set of stairs, but keep returning to the same level where they started. This is an optical illusion. Could there be a similar musical illusion? Could someone design a musical scale that always seems to be going up in pitch but also goes all the way around to the beginning? Someone could, and did."
"In eighteen ninety-eight, H.G. Wells published a science fiction novel called “The War of the Worlds.” In it, he described creatures from the planet Mars that had technology far beyond anything on Earth. Among their weapons was what Wells called a “heat ray.” Listen to actor Orson Welles describe the weapon in a famous radio broadcast of “The War of the Worlds” from nineteen thirty-eight."
"Forget the chocolates, roses and jewelry. This Valentine’s Day (Feb. 14), perhaps the best gift we can give our significant other is our undivided attention. Unfortunately for many, it’s easier said than done. A recent international survey of more than 13,000 adults found that in the company of their partner, nearly 40 percent felt their partner paid more attention to their mobile device."
"Over the past 10 years, South Africa has seen its major cities sprawl, their populations grow, and traffic on road and rail networks explode. Nowhere is this more evident than in the greater Johannesburg-Pretoria area. Passengers on overfilled commuter trains hang on the outside of carriages, and vehicles clog the roads. A rapid rail network under construction is meant to ease congestion."
"Cities such as Washington, Portland, Minneapolis, Seattle and New York are experiencing this change, mainly among 20 and 30-year-olds. “They now own fewer cars and drive fewer miles than their parents’ and their grandparents’ generations at the same age,” says Ralph Buehler, an associate professor of urban affairs and planning at Virginia Tech, and the author of a book about urban biking."
Residents and tourists in Washington D.C. can now examine a life-size replica of an unusual dinosaur that lived almost a hundred million years ago in northern Africa. Scientists say studying the behemoth named Spinosaurus helps them better understand how some prehistoric animals adapted to life on land and in water. The Spinosaurus replica is on display at the National Geographic Museum.
"Maasai craftswomen in the hills outside Nairobi, Kenya, and craft workers in Nepal make products for one store in the city, called Ten Thousand Villages. It is part of a national non-profit chain started by the Mennonites, a Christian denomination. The organization works with artisans in 35 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America to make sure they get a fair price for their products."
"The logician as such, with his predilection for water-tight compartments in the realm of ideas, is not concerned with what to me as a linguist seems a most important question, viz. how is it to be explained that a sequence of sounds with no meaning at all suddenly from non-connotative becomes connotative, and that this new full meaning is at once accepted by the whole speaking community?"
"Longwood Gardens in the eastern state of Pennsylvania has been described by many visitors as a horticultural paradise and attracts hundreds of thousands of nature lovers each year. Over the lush 424 hectares there are more than 40 different gardens and displays. VOA's Amitis Darabnia takes us inside the garden's conservatory, a large indoor facility that is home to 5,500 types of plants."
"Experts say the challenge now will be trying to decide how to distribute a swine flu vaccine. Since the seasonal flu virus vaccine that is in production for the coming flu season is not effective against H1N1, Andrew Pekosz of the Johns Hopkins University says public health officials will need to decide whether to incorporate it into the existing vaccine or make a standalone inoculation."
"On a crowded platform not too far from Natalia's spot, a Chinese man can be seen playing a traditional Chinese instrument, the erhu. His music is constantly interrupted by the roar of passing trains, or the blare of the public announcement system. Few people stop to listen to him, but those who do listen are rewarded, both by the music and by the smile of welcome on the musician's face."
"After years of election postponements and stalled negotiations, the last week has seen two hopeful developments: first, the nation’s special electoral court cut three prominent and controversial figures from the ballot—the coup leader, who had reneged on a promise not to run; the wife of the president who was overthrown in that 2009 coup; and the man who served as president before that."
"A Texas-based startup is giving consumers a unique way to memorialize their loved ones, by turning their cremated ashes into diamonds. Human ashes and even those from pets provide the starting material for diamonds that are grown in a lab. Tina Trinh interviews the founder of Eterneva, the company that provides this service, and a pet owner who is turning her dog’s ashes into a diamond."
"Geologists say the earth's crust is not a seamless skin. Rather, it is fractured into seven major plates, and more than a dozen lesser ones. These plates are not stationary; they move and collide with one another, creating what are known as faultlines. Along some faultlines, one plate's edge will sink beneath another. In other cases, the plates rub and slip sideways along the faultline."
"Mr. Cressman says control operations are still underway in the Sahelian countries and these will continue until the end of the year, at least until the locusts are gone. At the same time, ground and aerial control operations are already in progress in Morocco and Algeria in response to the incoming swarms from the Sahelian countries. Mr. Cressman says a two-pronged strategy is in place."
"Caviar, a delicacy usually associated with the sturgeon that swim in the Caspian Sea, is also being produced at an American sturgeon farm in the Western state of Idaho. Idaho caviar sells for $1 a gram at the farm, but sells for five times as much when it arrives at restaurants and stores. Lesia Bakalets traveled to the farm to see what it takes to raise sturgeons and collect their roe."
Hubble's top accomplishments include measuring the expansion and acceleration rate of the universe; finding that black holes are common among galaxies; characterizing the atmospheres of planets around other stars; monitoring weather changes on planets across our solar system; and looking back in time across 97% of the universe to chronicle the birth and evolution of stars and galaxies.
"It is easy to imagine that it was the bats that led ancient people to discover the cave. Archeologists and others have found evidence of Ice Age hunters near the cave entrance. They have also found pieces of spear points left about 10,000 years ago. More recently, Apache Indians painted pictures at the entrance. And evidence of one of their cooking areas was found beside a nearby path."
"A study of aspirin and strokes was published in the “Archives of Neurology.” Robert Hart and others at the University of Texas at San Antonio examined studies of aspirin and stroke prevention in more than fifty-thousand healthy people. Some of the people already had an increased risk of stroke, like high blood pressure. Others had no signs that they could suffer a stroke in the future."
Carolan wanted to learn how the organisms did that. So he studied the liver proteins of the two genetically-different mice. He and his team found that the liver cells of resistant mice had more copies of a protein than the mice that were more likely to be infected. The proteins create a chemical which the researchers believe could be toxic to the parasitic cells. But they are not sure.
"An off-duty security guard said he had not heard the news, but found it hard to believe that he would no longer see income tax deductions on his salary. He said he sent his family back to his rural home in April because he could no longer afford to pay rent in the capital. He said it was cheaper for him to share a room with other workers than rent space for his wife and three children."
"The simplicity of its republican origin had so far affected the external character and expression of the imperial office, that in the midst of luxury the most unbounded, and spite of all other corruptions, a majestic plainness of manners, deportment, and dress, had still continued from generation to generation, characteristic of the Roman imperator in his intercourse with his subjects."
"Zika, like dengue fever and West Nile virus, is in a family of mosquito-borne viruses called flaviviruses. A new study suggests that Zika can be much worse for people previously infected with another flavivirus. In pregnant women, it may put their babies at higher risk for serious birth defects, including microcephaly, a condition in which infants are born with abnormally small heads."
"Researchers made artificial versions of these peptides and tested the most promising one — DRGN-1, or DRAGON-1 — in wounded mice and human skin cell cultures. They found the protein molecules exhibited three outstanding properties: They destroyed the outer layer of bacteria, dissolved biofilms — a sticky colony that microbes form to shield against antibiotics — and speeded up healing."
"United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara says these high-tech bank heists do not require a mask, a gun, a note, or a getaway car. Instead, these modern-day criminals use advanced software called Zeus to secure private bank information by spying on unsuspecting victims while they use their computers. From there they set up a series of money transfers."
"You see, surveys are finding that more than one-third of America's five million farmers and their families live not in the cornfields or next to the dairy barn, but in town! Their farmhouses stand empty and unwatched at night. Or perhaps a caretaker stays there. Or someone who just likes living in the country is renting the place, while the farmer commutes to the fields each morning."
"They argued with him that it would be quite impossible for him to stand unanaesthetized the elaborate cutting and dissection necessary to complete an operation of this kind in a most important part of the body, where large nerves and arteries would have to be cut through and where the slightest disturbance on the part of the patient might easily lead to serious or even fatal results."
"Devlin concedes that while the mathematics in the show is very real, the series does take a few liberties. He admits that one person probably couldn't solve a criminal case so quickly, and wouldn't have the expertise in so many branches of math. Mathematics, he says, has exploded since the 19th century, and it's impossible for a single mathematician to know every single area of math."
"And when they were now departed out of the city, and had gone forward a little way: Joseph sending for the steward of his house, said: Arise, and pursue after the men: and when thou hast overtaken them, say to them: Why have you returned evil for good? The cup which you have stolen, is that in which my lord drinketh, and in which he is wont to divine: you have done a very evil thing."
"Tobacco, divine, rare, superexcellent tobacco, which goes far beyond all the panaceas, potable gold, and philosopher's stones, a sovereign remedy to all diseases...but as it is commonly abused by most men, which take it as tinkers do ale, 'tis a plague, a mischief, a violent purger of goods, lands, health, hellish, devilish and damned tobacco, the ruin and overthrow of body and soul."
"Several other herbs also showed strong antioxidant activity. They include bay and dill. However, their strength was about one-half to one-third as strong as that of the three kinds of oregano. Generally, the herbs used as medicines were low in antioxidant activity. The scientists say this suggests that any health effects from such herbs resulted mostly from other actions in the body."
"Now, an initiative from the private sector on wind-generated energy is paving the way forward. It’s part of a program funded in part by the World Bank called “Fighting Poverty.” It combines skilled artisans and the abundant supply of wind to make simple turbines. The local craftsmen make the wooden blades for the rotating fans, and the 10-foot high base upon which the turbines stand."
"While working for the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, he designed and built the second tide prediction machine which was used for over thirty years, wrote numerous theoretical treatises on tides and tidal currents, and published a series of essays in Coast and Geodetic Survey annual reports on such topics as “Meteorological Researches: Cyclones, Tornadoes, and Water-Spouts”."
"Goldberg cautioned that the Chinese study was observational, relying on information provided by the mothers many years after they had given birth, so the findings do not prove a cause-and-effect relationship. She said what's needed is a head-to-head comparison of women who breast-feed with a control group of those who don't, to see whether there are long-term heart-healthy benefits."
"There is, doubtless, no need to assure the reader that the events of Bob's life as hereinafter depicted are historically true; he was acquired by one of the poet's boys, who, forbidden to rob nests, remembers his fear, on the way home with Bob in his straw hat, that the account of the bird's helpless condition would not serve as a fair and reasonable excuse for keeping him as a pet."
"High school student Vivian Chau, like most Asian-American youngsters, loves a drink called boba, a sweet milk tea with jellied tapioca balls. Boba can be found in cafes around San Francisco, but Vivian says it is not sold in supermarkets. So she came up with the idea of a company called Jelly It! to make a ready-to-drink bottled tea mixed with jelly. She admits the idea is a gamble."
"The restoration of the Old City is just one part of a plan to revitalize the arts in Afghanistan. Besides woodworkers and engineers, the Turquoise Mountain Foundation also employs calligraphers and pottery experts. Eventually their works will be sold at art exhibitions and in galleries. The organizers see the plan as a way to generate income for the artists and boost Afghan culture."
"Second Life is an Internet-based simulation of reality — a virtual world with trees, buildings, animals and people. The ""people"" are animated characters guided by real-life people who can make their avatar look and act however they want. For someone with physical or emotional disabilities, this chance to ""dream"" through their online avatar can be a healing and empowering experience."
"Even higher-tech products, like computers, can be modified to suit local conditions. The One Laptop Per Child initiative was created by the U.S. non-profit group of the same name. The green and white laptops are lightweight, durable, and can be hand-cranked or solar-powered. They use open-source software, which allows children and their teachers to adapt the software to their needs."
People also have to take care of the Botanic Garden. But machines can do some of the work. Computers operate the environmental control system in the Conservatory. They can do things like raise and lower shade cloth over the windows and control heat and air-handling equipment. The computers make sure temperatures and humidity levels are just right in relation to the weather outside.
"Constantly regard the universe as one living being, having one substance and one soul; and observe how all things have reference to one perception, the perception of this one living being; and how all things act with one movement; and how all things are the cooperating causes of all things which exist; observe too the continuous spinning of the thread and the contexture of the web."
"The explorer’s greatest care, however, while camping out in the forest at night—his fires, his watchmen, and his watch-dogs—will not invariably secure him from danger, if there happen to be wild animals in the neighbourhood; leopards especially, insignificant in size as compared with the lion and the tiger,—there are few things so daring that a hungry leopard will not attempt them."
"I woke up the next morning, like I always do, when my phone began buzzing. I snoozed it for five or ten more minutes and finally brought myself to sit up on my bed. From there I could look out my window to the river, which looked so pretty with the shining sun. I started my day by looking at the river, and at my family’s pictures which I have hung up on my wall in front of my bed."
"The massive excavations for the canal expansion have resulted in a series of paleontological and archeological finds, which have kept Smithsonian scientists busy. The discoveries, mostly on the Atlantic side, include fossils and pre-Columbian artifacts. Scientists say some of the fossil remains could change prevailing theories about the geologic evolution of the Isthmus of Panama."
"For sheer ambitiousness, it's hard to top a conference that's coming up in San Francisco in November. It's titled Happiness and Its Causes, and who doesn't want to be happy? Over four days, 40 of what the program promises will be the best minds in psychology, philosophy, science, education, business, the arts, medicine, and politics will explore techniques for achieving happiness."
"Mackinac Island, Michigan is the only city in the United States where there are no motorized vehicles of any kind on the streets. It's been that way since the automobile was banned by city ordinance in 1898. The island's thousands of tourists go from place to place in horse-drawn taxi cabs. But the island's commitment to a unique way of life is being threatened by its own success."
"Kayihura distinguishes between agri-tourism and ecotourism. He says the one is basically about agriculture and individual farmers, while the other is a community affair with benefits to the local population. Kayihura also says it protects and conserves resources. He says the prospects for the agri-tourism concept are good and that it's already doing well in other parts of Africa."
"Many questions are left unanswered about Kahn. Yet, the film helps tell a very interesting story about a very important man. Louis Kahn died in nineteen seventy-four. Yet his influence lives on. While teaching at the University of Pennsylvania, he trained many future builders. Some students have become important architects. And Kahn’s architecture has remained fresh and timeless."
"Mt. Thielsen, namesake for the surrounding Wilderness Area, is called “The Lightning Rod of the Cascades.” A dormant volcano, its peak is struck by lightning so often that some rocks at the summit have melted into an unusual mineral called fulgurite. This mineral is made of natural hollow glass tubes formed when silica is subjected to high temperatures, such as lightning strikes."
"In the 2011–2012 growing season, the Mauritanian government began some new strategies to increase the yield and amount of crops grown. By training young farmers about agriculture, investing money into more irrigation, and introducing genetically modified crops that can survive in Mauritanian conditions, leaders of the country are hopeful that better times are to come for farming."
"Overcoming severe radiation damage, the redoubtable orbiter has deployed a probe into Jupiter's atmosphere; studied the hottest volcanoes in the Solar System on Jupiter's moon Io; discovered evidence of subsurface oceans on the moons Europa and Ganymede; and provided new insights into the giant planet's stormy atmosphere, gigantic magnetosphere and energetic particle environment."
"Snow also is known to influence the movement of sound waves. When there is fresh snow on the ground, the surface of the snow takes in, or absorbs, sound waves. However, snow can become hard and flat as it becomes older or if there have been strong winds. Then the snow’s surface will help to send back sound waves. Under these conditions, sounds may seem clearer and travel farther."
"If you're an American and you're frustrated with your job, your relationships, maybe the amount of hair on your head; or if you're looking to get ahead in business or want to make a fortune in real estate or the stock market; or if you want to improve your memory or better manage your time or learn new computer skills, somewhere there's a conference or seminar or retreat for you."
"These poems might nearly all have been written by one man, were it possible for one man to vary from absolute platitude to something like genius, so homogeneous is their tone: everywhere do we meet the same simplicity of diction struggling with the same complication and subtlety of thought, the same abstract speculation strangely mingled with most individual and personal pathos."
"Treating fibromyalgia can be difficult. Since there is no cure, doctors may experiment with different treatments and medicines. Some drugs work with some patients, but do not work with others. Patients with mild fibromyalgia often do not need any drugs. Their condition can improve with a combination of low-impact exercises, a good diet, getting enough rest and patient education."
"There are about 864,000 children under the age of five that we will reach with this vaccine, and surrounding countries, particularly Uzbekistan and Kyrgyztan, are being asked to step up their surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis, which is a sign of polio, and to look into their immunization rates to make sure that children are adequately protected in those surrounding areas."
"Recent studies at an international agricultural research institute in Colombia have shown that a grass used to feed livestock, known as Brachiaria, could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from livestock and agriculture and reduce the use of commercial fertilizers. In the United States, for example, agriculture and livestock account for six percent of greenhouse gas emissions."
"Hundreds of officers with salaries, bonuses and state-funded apartments are carrying out ridiculous work: on orders from the very top, they are searching the apartments of ordinary people, going through their personal belongings, photographs, rifling through documents, confiscating computers and other electronics, and then carrying out lengthy interrogations that can last hours."
"Dr. Villa and colleagues have developed a vaccine that kept 90 percent of young women from becoming infected with four types of HPV virus. The vaccine protected 100 percent of the women who became infected with the virus against the development of genital warts, a condition that often leads to cervical cancer, and abnormal cervical lesions, another precursor to cervical cancer."
"The task, although rather arduous, was not displeasing to me, for a residence of several years in Egypt had rendered me tolerably proficient in the Arabic language and colloquial dialect, and my prior travels in various parts of the Sudan had made me familiar with the habits of the natives, besides procuring me the acquaintance of many merchants from the more distant provinces."
"Obesity is not just an American problem anymore. A recent international survey by the Worldwatch Institute found that nearly two billion people around the world are overweight. Health statistics were gathered from 177 countries. Researchers there say the trend is being driven, ironically, by rising personal income, which is leading people to eat fattier foods and exercise less."
"Athletes have to focus on five disciplines each day, starting with the 100-meter sprint, long jump, shot put, high jump and 400-meter run. The second day includes the 110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw and 1,500-meter race. Competitors accumulate points based on their performance. Roman Sebrle of the Czech Republic holds the world record of 9,026 points."
"Other unusual characteristics of a seahorse are its upright stance, with its prehensile tail — which allows it to hold on to coral and other sea objects. Their tiny size, usually less than 15 centimeters, gives them a ""jewel-like"" appearance. And seahorses don't have the scales of typical fish; instead they have a dark, exo-skeleton of bony plates for protection and camouflage."
"Aviation experts call it automation addiction, an overreliance on the computerized flying of passenger jets. But that same technology has helped make airline travel safer than ever. The report by the Federal Aviation Administration agrees with that, but says pilots are not as skilled at manually flying a plane in emergencies or when transitioning back from automation to manual."
"For people who live in a culture where most of their interests are shared by most others as a matter of course, it can be easy to overlook those who don't fit into their mold. That's why N'Gai Croal, technology editor for Newsweek magazine and an African-American, is only half jesting when he says that the results from search engines often reflect ""the tyranny of the majority."""
"In the painting, George Washington is depicted seated in uniform, rising to the heavens with a rainbow at his feet. At either side are female figures representing Liberty and Victory. Encircling him are 13 maidens, each with a star overhead, symbolizing the first states of the union. They hold a banner with the national motto in Latin, ""E Pluribus Unum"", or ""out of many, one."""
"Howard Rheingold glances up from his oversized computer screen. It's the most familiar object among many, mostly foreign, curios that fill his colorful home office. As a freelance writer, Mr. Rheingold has authored several books and countless magazine articles. Still, he feels special affection for his published compendium of strange — and strangely useful — non-English words."
"In addition to these protected sanctuaries, says Webster, there are also managed reserves, where diseased oysters are removed and replaced with disease-free hatchery seed. The oysters are allowed to grow until 60 percent of them are at least 10 centimeters long. Once the oysters have reached adult size, the reserves are opened up for harvest, supporting the commercial fishery."
"In an era when urban growth and suburban sprawl often threaten the natural habitats of America's wildlife, places where birds, animals and plants can safely thrive have become increasingly precious. That is the rationale behind the nation's National Wildlife Refuge System a set of over 500 preserves where the needs of wildlife are given top priority even over human recreation."
"CO₂ building up in the atmosphere and trapping solar heat over the past century is widely blamed for today's melting glaciers, shrinking ice sheets and rising ocean waters. But other heat-trapping pollutants have a more short-term impact, and the researchers say cutting those emissions could be a more effective way to slow the rate of climate warming and reduce sea-level rise."
"Artist Nancy Cohen created a large piece called “Estuary: Moods and Modes.” It is a three dimensional representation of a protected river system in the state of New Jersey. She made the work from handmade yellow, blue and green paper. It extends over the walls and floor of an entire room in the exhibit. The artist says the piece shows how interdependent parts hang in balance."
"The money will be used to buy equipment for patrols and build offshore fishing vessels for the Vietnam Coast Guard, the Vietnam Fisheries Resources Surveillance Force and fishermen. This includes construction of 3,000 steel-clad fishing boats, Tran Cao Muu, General Secretary of the Vietnam Fisheries Association said. The current fleet of around 100,000 boats are made of wood."
"A laser fires a light beam. Before the laser, scientists developed a similar device: a maser which stands for Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. A maser is basically a microwave version of the laser. Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation similar to, but shorter than, radio waves. The best-known use of masers is in highly accurate clocks."
"An old man told his grandson, ""My son, there is a battle between two wolves inside us all. One is evil. It is anger, jealousy, greed, resentment, inferiority, lies and ego. The other is good. It is joy, peace, love, hope, humility, kindness, empathy and truth."" The boy thought about it and asked, ""Grandfather, which wolf wins?"" The old man quietly replied, ""The one you feed."""
"It is a glorious Monday at the Santa Monica Pier in Southern California. The perfect day for a ride on the Ferris wheel, or the roller coaster. Below the steel track of the coaster, parents beam as their kids tilt-a-whirl or smack each other around in bumper cars. Little kids toddle by with their dripping ice cream cones. It just doesn't get any better than this. Or does it?"
"From the late nineteen thirties to the late nineteen forties, Bob Feller was called the best pitcher in major league baseball. He threw the ball harder than any other pitcher of his time. He was known for his fastball. People sought to measure its speed using different methods. It was measured at between one hundred fifty-seven and one hundred seventy-two kilometers an hour."
"Until now, scientists couldn’t distinguish the silent bacteria from the active ones to know whether dormant mycobacterium were being killed by different compounds. Abramovitch and colleagues developed a strain of the pathogen that glows bright green. They found it stopped glowing after artemisinin came into contact with the mycobacteria’s oxygen biosensor, presumably dying."
"The virus “has thrived because poverty, inequality, discrimination, the destruction of our natural environment and other human rights failures have created enormous fragilities in our societies,” Guterres said, while simultaneously providing leaders with a pretext to impose “heavy-handed security responses and repressive measures that curtail civic space and media freedom.”"
"Traveling is not just a variety of sensations; it is even more, and above all, an inexhaustible source of good and wholesome experiences, a perennial fountain of lively enthusiasm for all that is beautiful, new, and original, and a fertile source of analysis, observation, and criticism, which is seldom to be found in the country where we were born or the city where we live."
"Cooking crabs is fairly easy. But eating them can be a challenge. The shells are still very hard. Some people use special tools called crackers and mallets to crack the shells and reach the meat. Other use their hands, breaking at weak points of the shell. Either way, it is a messy meal that usually leaves the eaters covered in shell, bits of meat and lots of red seasoning."
"He writes his history upon his field; how many ties, how many resources, he has,—his friendships with his cattle, his team, his dog, his trees, the satisfaction in his growing crops, in his improved fields; his intimacy with nature, with bird and beast, and with the quickening elemental forces; his cooperations with the clouds, the sun, the seasons, heat, wind, rain, frost!"
"That story was so funny I literally died from laughter. ""Then how come you're talking to me now?"" ""Of course, I didn't actually die, it was just a figure of speech."" ""So you're saying you used 'literally' in a figurative way."" ""Apparently. Got a problem with that?"" ""No, just finding it amusing that language can twist to the point that a word comes to mean its own opposite."""
"To disturb a Nomenclature of long standing, to set aside terms in familiar use, and to set up others in their place which are strange, and therefore at first unintelligible, involves an interruption of that facility with which we are accustomed to communicate with one another on any given subject, that is only to be justified by reasons of a cogent and satisfactory nature."
"Also Tuesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended people who have had potential exposure to Zika put off donating blood for at least four weeks. They include people who show any symptoms of Zika, anyone who has traveled to a Zika-stricken area, and those who have had sex with someone who lived in or traveled to one of those countries in the last three months."
"Until you've had sunrises and sunsets on the water, or been caught in a bad storm, or pulled a bag of fish aboard the boat and gone out expecting to have a terrible day and had a wonderful one (or vice versa), you just can't appreciate just how fundamental it is to be able to go out and say 'I know or I believe I am good enough to be able to earn for myself and my family.'"
"This snow-flake grew larger and larger, till at last it became the figure of a woman, dressed in garments of white gauze, which looked like millions of starry snow-flakes linked together. She was fair and beautiful, but made of ice- shining and glittering ice. Still she was alive and her eyes sparkled like bright stars, but there was neither peace nor rest in their glance."
"France is not the first country to look at the non-material aspects of progress. The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan emphasizes a concept it calls 'gross national happiness,' rather than GDP. Bhutan's main research center collects a wide variety of data to measure this, including things like psychological well being, good governance, ecological diversity and living standards."
"Mongoose are just one of many threats facing Hawaii's birds. There are other invasive animals and plants, insect-borne diseases, and habitat destruction. Bortner says the Fish and Wildlife Service has joined with other groups to restore habitats, install predator traps and fencing and support captive breeding programs for such endangered bird species as the Hawaiian crow."
"The newly discovered planet is relatively near us, about 15 light years from Earth. It is not precisely like our home planet, but a bigger cousin, estimated to be six to eight times Earth's mass, twice the diameter, and so close to its star that it takes less than two days to orbit, making its temperatures oven-like. The star itself is only one-third the mass of our Sun."
"Camels are known for their ability to travel long distances across the desert without water, but they’re also becoming an increasingly important source of milk for people in drought-prone regions, including East African countries like Kenya, where populations of camels, the single-humped kind technically known as dromedaries, have grown rapidly over the past few decades."
"If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself."
"The ground-hog is found in all parts of the region extending from the Atlantic coast west to the Missouri, Iowa, and Minnesota. It inhabits woods, prairies, and meadows, lives on roots, vegetables, and herbs, and is especially fond of red clover. Its burrows are large excavations, and in the early autumn it busies itself in storing provisions for its long winter retreat."
"Scientists have made a genetic map of the tomato. Tomatoes are second only to potatoes as the world's most valuable vegetable crop. Eight years of work went into making the map, or genome. Three hundred scientists around the world took part in the project to sequence the tomato's DNA code. Giovanni Giuliano, a researcher in Italy, is part of the Tomato Genome Consortium."
"Cougars — also known as mountain lions, pumas and panthers — were once the top predator in the forests of eastern North America, but they were wiped out by the early 1900s due to habitat destruction, hunting and loss of their primary prey, deer. The last confirmed sighting of the big cats was more than 100 years ago, but that hasn't stopped people from looking for them."
"Anywhere else in the world, this would be a fisherman's dream, rivers so abundant with fish they jump out of the water, and often right into the boat. But these are not the kind of fish that get anglers in the United States excited. They are known as Asian Carp and the explosion of their population in the Illinois River is a concern to large-river ecologist Kevin Irons."
"The translucent and shining waters of the calm sea covered fragments of old Roman villas, which were interlaced by sea-weed, and received diamond tints from the chequering of the sun-beams; the blue and pellucid element was such as Galatea might have skimmed in her car of mother of pearl; or Cleopatra, more fitly than the Nile, have chosen as the path of her magic ship."
"Visitors get a feel for the colonial lifestyle by watching the costumed interpreters practice ancient crafts, such as blacksmithing and brickmaking, in much the same way they were practiced in 1700s America. People can stop by the apothecary to find out which medicines were used in colonial times or they can check out the milliner for fashionable accessories of the day."
"The case studies consider how non-climate factors like population growth, development, and land management interact with the problems of a warming planet. For example, along Louisiana's Gulf of Mexico coastline, wetlands play an important role in the quality of life, helping to sustain the U.S. economy and protecting people and property from the dangers of storm surges."
"After the training phase, ""C-Path"" (Computational Pathologist) evaluated a second set of pathology slides, which came from a different hospital and which were medically and demographically different from the training group. It actually did better than human pathologists, although Koller stresses that C-Path is not designed to replace doctors looking through microscopes."
"A new report released on May 7 finds that locally owned African seed companies now dominate Africa’s seed industry. The analysis was conducted by the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). It revealed that 80 small- to medium-sized African seed companies in 16 countries are equipped to produce over 80,000 metric tons of professionally certified seeds in 2014."
"The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in America — the third largest in the world. A century ago it boasted an oyster fishery second to none. Ships reportedly would run aground on its mountainous oyster reefs. No more. The shellfish population has been devastated by overfishing, pollution and development. But, efforts are underway to rebuild the Bay's oyster reefs."
Doctor Cawkwell says Pfizer is studying patients with fibromyalgia in China and Japan. And she says the company is looking at what she calls “bio-markers” in people with fibromyalgia. Bio-markers help researchers know what is happening in the bodies of people with a disease or medical condition. Doctor Cawkwell says it is important to find bio-markers for fibromyalgia.
"Indeed, they had never passed the grotto without leaving some token of respect. In the morning when they led their flocks to pasture, and again in the evening ere they started home, they paid worship to the Deities, and presented either a flower, a green bough, some fruit, or a libation of milk, as an offering; and this piety, as we shall see presently, had its reward."
"Those of us who took part in the foundation of the Society for Psychical Research were convinced from personal investigation and from the testimony of competent witnesses that, amidst much illusion and deception, there existed an important body of facts, hitherto unrecognised by science, which, if incontestably established, would be of supreme interest and importance."
"And then the happenings of some wild and remote place will be heard by electronic ears and recorded and catalogued in a digital language of waves. Crests and troughs carrying the muted hoots of owls, the lonesome calls of wolves, the wind raking through spruce boughs, or a kind of purity and peacefulness beyond description, glabrous as glare ice and just as condensed."
"Graham Blake grew up on Sarah Creek, a tributary to the bay. His father and grandfather made a good living as watermen by harvesting, transplanting, fattening, and then re-harvesting oysters from the creek. It was an early form of oyster farming. In the 1940s and ‘50s his family could harvest 200 to 300 bushels of oysters each day. Blake says those days are long-gone."
"Researchers say it makes sense that loss of hearing might be caused by anemia. The inside of the ear is very sensitive to oxygen, and it's possible that the nerves there are not getting enough in someone who is iron-deficient. Iron is an essential element for the production of hemoglobin, the red blood cell protein that carries and releases oxygen throughout the body."
"According to a new study, the thawing Alaskan permafrost is releasing emissions of nitrous oxide at a rate about 12 times higher than thought. Along with being the third most significant greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide, once it combines with sunlight and oxygen in the stratosphere can convert to nitrogen oxides. This is something scientists say may harm the ozone layer."
"The ozone damaging the lungs of these young adults is an invisible gas, made of three oxygen atoms. When it's inhaled, ozone can irritate and inflame the sensitive internal tissues of the respiratory system. Nolen adds that ozone is usually accompanied by particle pollution such as diesel engine exhaust, which can cause further problems like heart attacks and strokes."
"Ah, Alsace! It is usually known for the beauty of its half-timbered houses, its renowned gastronomy and its famous Christmas markets. However, it is also a cultural crossroads in the heart of Europe. It links France, Switzerland and Germany through an incredible diversity of landscapes where, flanked by mountains and the banks of the Rhine, open-air activities abound."
"Composites are usually herbs and shrubs, although there are a few tree composites. Various composites are cultivated for food including sunflower seeds, lettuce, artichokes, chicory, endive, and salsify. The most common human use of this very large family is for garden ornamentals. A few such as chamomile, colt's foot, and wormwood have been used as medicinal plants."
"Indeed, by now, although the god of the Shepherds was Baal, to whom they gave the name of Set because already it was well known upon the Nile, the Shepherd kings re-built the temples of Ra and Amun and Ptah, of Isis and of Hathor, that their forefathers had destroyed when first they invaded Egypt, and themselves made offerings in them, acknowledging these divinities."
"Dr. James Stannard, developed this procedure with James Cook, a veterinarian who heads a regenerative orthopaedics laboratory and is director of operations and research at the university’s BioJoint Center. Stannard is chair of orthopaedic surgery at the university’s School of Medicine. The technique replaces a patient’s damaged cartilage with healthy donor cartilage."
"With international climate talks under way in Bali, Indonesia, [12/3-14] the non-profit Pew Center on Global Climate Change released a report examining the impact climate change is having on different regions of the United States. The study argues that federal, state and local decision-makers must work both to mitigate global warming and to adapt to its consequences."
The need for artificial nests demonstrates why the African penguin is listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Much of the penguin's natural habitat has been destroyed. Commercial fishing fleets have also reduced their food supply. Chivell has formed the Dyer Island Conservation Trust to install 800 nests at this site.
"The Wind Power Center obtains most of its operating power from a wind turbine atop a 50-meter-tall tower in its windmill park. On good, windy days the turbine often produces more electricity than the center needs, so the excess is sold to the local power company. On days when the turbine is not producing enough power, the center draws electricity from the local grid."
"Today we are witnessing an impoverishment: the apparent drying up of resources for all kinds of things that are badly needed. We seem to have no money for housing, for education, or for health and social services. And yet we have a deficit, and we are told by candidates for public office that we must cut the federal budget even more. This impoverishment is a mystery."
"Between the ages of one and four, young children should consume no more than 118 milliliters of fruit juice, the doctors' group says. The academy recommends that children between the ages of four and six restrict their juice intake to no more than 177 milliliters a day, while children between seven and 18 should limit their fruit juice consumption to 236 milliliters."
"Morocco's efforts to fight trachoma are paying off. In the hardest-hit province of Zagora, for example, active trachoma rates have fallen from more than 50 percent in 1997 to less than four percent today. Morocco's trachoma elimination program director, Dr. Youssef Chami, points out that the country could not have done it without the solid support of the government."
"Some economists, however, are warning that in the pledge-making rush, political leaders are making promises they’re unlikely to be able to keep without major economic damage and are not being honest with voters about the huge transformation that’s going to be needed, and the large costs involved, most of which are likely to be shouldered by taxpayers and households."
"There are already a number of products and methods used to boost athletic performance that the International Olympic Committee considers to be illegal. For example, there’s a hormone that can boost red blood cell production, making more oxygen available. That increases endurance. Then there are anabolic steroids and human growth hormone, which promote muscle growth."
Time and elasticity of boyhood had so closed the sharp but evanescent wound in Billy's heart that he could stand the trial of being groomsman where he had wanted to be groom—more especially since he was supported through the emergency by a little sister of Lottie's who promised to be wondrously like her by the time Billy could stand up in the more enviable capacity.
"Kalema-Zikusoka says her group works with villagers to develop the tourism potential of healthy and well cared for animals. For example, tourists in Uganda will often pay up to $500 to view gorillas for one hour. In fact, she says half of the revenue for the Uganda Wildlife Authority, the country’s wildlife management agency, comes from mountain gorilla eco-tourism."
"Horned toads hopped about; each of the four upper corners of the room was festooned with a thick cobweb, in the center of which sat a spider as big around as a washbasin, and armed with pincher-like claws; a red-and-green lizard was stretched at full length on the window-sill and black rats darted in and out of the holes they had gnawed in the floor of the cottage."
"In the so-called golden age of bathing, people of means flocked to bathhouse palaces for the pampering. Others went to bathhouses in remote mountain towns in the belief that their mineral-rich waters, bubbling from springs deep beneath the earth, offered curative powers. Treatments at bathhouse spas were said to cure everything from nervousness to gout to syphilis."
"If the player deliberately touches any of his pieces, he must move it, provided he can make a valid move with it. If he deliberately touches an opponent's piece, it must be captured, if capture is legally possible. This rule applies to all formal chess competitions. Players who intend to fail to observe this rule, in friendly matches, must agree on this in advance."
"As a researcher and cardiologist, Dr. Christopher M. O'Connor, of the Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina, has seen studies of new-drug effectiveness that seemed to have different results in different countries. So he combined the results from several studies investigating the effectiveness of drugs called beta blockers for patients with heart failure."
"Their newly developed device is centered on a microscopically small lever that vibrates in the presence of bacterial activity. A laser focused on the lever reads the vibration and then translates it into electrical signals that can be easily read. If there’s no signal, according to the researchers, that means there’s no bacteria. The entire test only takes minutes."
"We had our landlord's company at supper, and had learned from him that the most eminent of American financiers, who shall not otherwise be identified here, was in the habit, when coming to Leghorn, of letting him know that he was bringing a party of friends, and commanding of him a banquet such as he alone knew how to furnish a millionaire of that princely quality."
"Sally Boysen has been studying chimpanzee cognition for over 30 years. A psychologist at Ohio State University, she has focused on chimps' ability to understand numbers and tools, their ability to recognize loved ones, and their seemingly altruistic natures. In the near future, she hopes to teach them to read simple English words. She also really loves her chimps."
"Instinctively they fly toward the friendly support of some tall weed where, as if feeling more secure on their feet than in the air, they resume their antics, hanging their heads downward, twirling their tails, jumping from one weed to another, and each bird apparently communicating its restlessness to its neighbor, until the whole colony is in a state of ferment."
"Researchers noted aspirin reduces inflammation, which plays a role in the initiation of disease. They also said the painkiller is a mild aromatase inhibitor. Aromatase inhibitors reduce the amount of the female hormone estrogen circulating in the bloodstream, which fuels breast tumors, so they are used to treat some forms of breast cancer in post-menopausal women."
"Performing before more than 700 children, the company of the Alabama Shakespeare Festival delivers early lines from one of the Bard's last plays, the dark comedy, The Tempest. American children are not known for their attention spans, but the youngsters sit spellbound as the Magician Prospero and his daughter Miranda argue the fate of the Prince and his shipmates."
"One of the reasons Twitter is popular in Japan is a characteristic of Japanese itself: Japanese uses ideograms which enable it to convey more information in just 140 characters than other languages, not counting Chinese. Incidentally, the Japanese version of this sentence is written with exactly 140 characters. How many characters does it take in other languages?"
"We can't combat a disease like Zika that recognizes no borders — mosquitos don't respect walls — unless we make permanent the same urgency that we brought to bear against Ebola — by strengthening our own systems of public health, by investing in cures and rolling back the root causes of disease, and helping poorer countries develop a public health infrastructure."
"Indeed the Church has spoken and prayed in the languages of all peoples since Pentecost. Nevertheless, the Christian communities of the early centuries made frequent use of Greek and Latin, languages of universal communication in the world in which they lived and through which the newness of Christ’s word encountered the heritage of the Roman-Hellenistic culture."
"As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements, that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone."
"In the short-term, Norfolk has responded with flood walls, powerful pumping stations, drains and storm pipes. And in hotspots, houses and roads are being raised and wetlands allowed to regrow. Assistant city manager Ron Williams is charged with projects like the highway across from Norfolk’s medical center. When it’s done, the road will be one-half meter higher."
We move from the relative cool of the Garden Court into the warmth of a jungle. Sunlight from outside shines on this thick green world. The light comes through the top of the building. The glass-covered area in the Palm Court is about twenty-eight meters high. We can climb steps to see the palm trees and other growth from above. Or we can ride up in an elevator.
"The idea of common prosperity is nothing new to the average Chinese citizen. The late Deng Xiaoping, the father of “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” announced economic reforms in 1978 with the ultimate goal of achieving common prosperity. The reforms he instituted while he was China’s supreme leader jumpstarted 40 years of rapid economic growth in China."
"Well you know, it isn’t a very good profession for making money. Not at all, it isn’t. Most of the good naturalists don’t make any money whatever. All they do is spend money, buying butterfly-nets and cases for birds’ eggs and things. It is only now, after I have been a naturalist for many years, that I am beginning to make a little money from the books I write."
"Steve Fossett did not limit himself to sailing and flying. He also competed in the one thousand eight hundred kilometer race through Alaska called the Iditarod Dogsled Race. And, he entered the Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii. Competitors must complete one hundred eighty kilometers of bicycling, forty-two kilometers of running and almost four kilometers of swimming."
"The strong hurricanes bearing down on the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico this year have caused renewed interest in predicting these violent tropical cyclones. Forecasting them has improved significantly in the last 25 years, providing more lead time for evacuation and other protective measures. But, it is still an imprecise science that needs a lot of fine-tuning."
"A bio-diverse ecosystem is often a delicate balance, and it doesn’t take much to upset it. In her research, co-author Diane Srivastava has studied the cascading effects of extinction. In one experiment, the University of British Columbia ecologist removed the ecosystem’s top predator — a damsel fly larva — from a single bromeliad plant — with surprising results."
"Barns that have survived have become romantic landmarks and nostalgic curiosities. Thousands have been put to non-agricultural uses as historic museums, antique shops, firehouses and bed-and-breakfast inns. Preservationists are pleased that these relics have been rescued. But almost always, something is missing from this happy picture: a cornfield or a pasture."
"According to the researchers these metabolic movements are almost imperceptible. So in order to measure and test for this activity, the researchers first put bacteria on an extremely sensitive measuring device which in turn would vibrate a tiny lever that is only just a little bit thicker than a strand of hair if it detects metabolic activity from the microbes."
"But research by Hyun Lillehoj and her team could offer a new way to reduce losses from the disease. Hyun Lillehoj is an immunologist in the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture. She works in the Animal Parasitic Diseases Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland. She led a team of scientists from research centers in South Korea."
"The rocket rose higher and higher. For five minutes, Alan Shepard felt the weightlessness of space. He felt himself floating. Freedom Seven flew one hundred eighty-five kilometers high. Then it re-entered the atmosphere and the spacecraft slowed. The fifteen-minute flight ended with a soft splash into the ocean about five hundred kilometers from Cape Canaveral."
"In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public excitement, and gave rise to so many strange conjectures."
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a series of sharp restrictions on Israelis to combat the spread of COVID-19. The measures include an almost-total shutdown of the country except for pharmacies and supermarkets and a ban on gatherings of more than ten people. He also said he wants to use cyber-measures to track the locations of those infected.
"Aeolus wooed and married the dainty Aurora, goddess of the morning, who bore him his sons, i.e. Boreas, the north wind; Notus, the south wind; Eurus, the east wind; and Zephyrus, the soft and gentle west wind. Sometimes Aurora sought the services of her children, but they were entirely under the control of their father Aeolus who ruled them with a strict hand."
"The study, conducted by researchers at the New York University (NYU) School of Medicine and published Thursday in the Particle and Fibre Toxicology Journal, indicates that common fireworks displays and other commercially available fireworks that explode in the air release heavy metals such as titanium, copper, strontium and even lead particulates into the air."
"As Albert Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity approaches its centennial year, new challenges abound. Relativity is often at odds with the second pillar of modern physics — quantum mechanics — which focuses on atomic and sub-atomic particles. Does Dr. Ransom think there are many scientists who are still eager to prove the famous theoretical physicist wrong?"
"Julissa, however, climbed up more slowly. Ruffles on her dress made it harder to enter the limousine. When she finally sat down gracefully, her attendants cheered. Every so often, Julissa and the others stood and pushed their heads out of the limousine’s skylight opening. Julissa held onto her tiara, a jeweled headpiece, as the wind tossed her long, dark hair."
"To climb the rubble slope without displacing the shale was impossible; to do so without making sufficient noise to alarm the sentinel was hardly feasible in such a still night. This might have been done in blustering wind and lashing rain, not on such a night as that when the bullfrog's call rang down the valley and was answered by another frog a mile distant."
"One of the most popular and successful ways hackers infect your computer is through a technique called phishing. Phishing occurs when someone opens an email attachment that looks real. But the attachment is actually a virus that immediately infects the user’s computer. If someone sends you a file or a website you did not ask for, it is best to not click on it."
"When a coral egg and sperm join together as an embryo, they develop into a coral larva, called a planula. Planulae float in the ocean, some for days and some for weeks, before dropping to the ocean floor. Then, depending on seafloor conditions, the planulae may attach to the substrate and grow into a new coral colony at the slow rate of about .4 inches a year."
"She says many producers traditionally use drug treatments and live parasite vaccines against coccidiosis. But the coccidia parasite is increasingly resistant to drug treatment. Also, some of the drugs used to treat the disease are antibiotics. Many people are concerned about antibiotics in animals because of the increasing problem of drug resistance in humans."
"70 years after the Second World War, warplanes of that era still attract a lot of attention and admiration, both for their designers and the crews that flew in them. Although manufactured in the tens of thousands, only a small number remain, kept in flying condition by devoted enthusiasts who pass their love for vintage aircraft from generation to generation."
"At a community center on Shek Lei public housing estate in northern Hong Kong, stacks of mooncake boxes are waiting to be distributed on Mid-Autumn Festival the following day. Inside they contain some of the 76,000 mooncakes that have been collected by Food Grace, a local charity, this holiday season to be redistributed to low-income families and individuals."
"Choreographer Meghan Flanigan spent the last five years in Bogota, Colombia, where she helped shape the dance community. During her stay, she helped form the dance company Con Cuerpos, which brings together professional dancers and Bogota's disabled homeless to create enlightened performances. We introduce you to her in this week's Making a Difference series."
"Do not I know my godson? have not I been enabled to read every thought in Van Baerle’s mind, and every sentiment in his heart? You ask whether he is strong or weak. He is neither the one nor the other; but that is not now the question. The principal point is, that he is sure not to divulge the secret, for the very good reason that he does not know it himself."
"Having formerly supported construction of a $400 million bridge over Alaska’s Inside Passage, Sarah later made fun of the idea, saying it would have been “a bridge to nowhere.” Although the bridge was never built, Alaska spent $26 million to build “a road to nowhere,” a five-kilometre two-lane gravel road across a small portion of a sparsely populated island."
"The Brazilian flag has a green background (alluding to the rainforest) with a yellow diamond (representative of gold and the country's wealth in mineral resources) in whose center a starry blue disc symbolizes the sky of the region, with the number of stars corresponding to the states of the federation. In the central belt is inscribed a motto of the country."
"U.S. Ambassador Dr. Peter M. Haymond handed over 93 containers of fortified rice, lentils, canned fish and fortified cooking oil to Deputy Minister of Education and Sports, Dr. Sisouk Vongvichith at the World Food Programme’s (WFP) warehouse in Vientiane today. The food will be used to prepare healthy school lunches for 63,000 school children around Lao PDR."
"Sue Beffel is the site leader for the cleanup at Colvin Run. The Virginia stream is one of 428 cleanup sites all along the Potomac River, which runs through Washington, DC and flows into the Chesapeake Bay, an estuary on the Atlantic coast. There's a wide variety of trash to clean up, including tires, plastic bottles, beer cans, and other careless cast-offs."
"Those writers own, indeed, that the chronicles to which they had access were filled with battles that were never fought, and Consuls that were never inaugurated; and we have abundant proof that, in these chronicles, events of the greatest importance, such as the issue of the war with Porsena and the issue of the war with Brennus, were grossly misrepresented."
Mr. Cowles' studies showed how plant communities could make important changes in land. His work demonstrated how groups of plants could create conditions for a sand dune to become a living forest. He became a well-known professor and researcher. The work of Henry Chandler Cowles in the Indiana Dunes helped spread the science of ecology throughout the world.
"Her Majesty the Queen-Regent of Holland has graciously accorded special permission to the writer of the following article to visit the Royal Palaces of Amsterdam and The Hague to obtain photographs for publication in this Magazine: a privilege of the greatest value, which is now accorded for the first time, the palaces never before having been photographed."
"Syrian refugees are bonding with their Arizona neighbors through food — specifically dessert. Volunteers are helping the Syrian bakers sell their homemade pastries at farmers markets, special events and bookstores. The names of the sweets — namoura, ma’amoul, barazek — are unfamiliar to American consumers, but the tastes of honey, cinnamon and nuts are not."
"By a microscope, the bug will be seen to have eight legs, two feelers, and an abdomen something egg-shaped; colour livid red; and in size no bigger than the point of a small needle. They lacerate the epidermis in some way or other, as a small hole is observable where they have been seated; and cause extreme itching and considerable inflammation of the part."
"For years, science fiction writers have imagined cloaking devices that could make objects or people invisible. While invisibility cloaks are still a fantasy, scientists have developed the optical materials that could some day make the illusion a reality. As VOA's Jessica Berman reports the materials, which bend light, have more serious applications as well."
"This thought, that a man may forfeit his rights, is as essential to proper conceptions of civil government, and civil liberty, as the thought that a man has rights; for if there be no forfeiture of rights through crime, then all legal punishments are without foundation in justice; even the right of self-defense, individually and nationally, ceases to exist."
"The road which was made under the superintendence of Captain (afterwards Colonel) Guthrie, of the Bengal Engineers between 1837 and 1844, at the joint expense of the British and Manipuri Governments, the former paying the larger share, was excellent for foot passengers and pack animals, but not wide enough and too steep for wheeled traffic on a large scale."
"As soon as the liquor is in the hogshead, the yeast, or fermenting principle, is put into it, stirred for some moments, and then left to itself. A liquor as rich as the above described ferments with force, and runs with rapidity through all the periods of fermentation. It is fit to distil as soon as that tumultuous state has subsided and the liquor is calm."
"Proponents of Big Tech say the march of technology into our daily lives is designed to make our lives easier. For some, it's arguable if a smart refrigerator can actually make life easier. But for the disabled community, technological advances can make a huge difference. Some of that new technology was on display this week at the Consumer Electronics' show."
"Research has shown that ultraviolet radiation, exposure to pesticides and other chemicals, and parasitic infections all can cause deformities in amphibians. In the case of the parasite, the target is the base of the tadpole's tail, where the hind legs develop. Infected tadpoles grow into frogs with too many legs, abnormal legs, or sometimes no legs at all."
"Dutch, French, English, Danes, Portuguese, and Courlanders would gallantly seize each other's property out there, while their respective Governments at home, if the matter were brought before their notice, and it was apparently worth their while, disowned all knowledge of their representatives' villainies and returned the booty to the prior owner on paper."
"Instinctively, his eyes and mine met, and, at that moment, there was established between us an understanding that was in strong contrast to the surrounding turmoil, which now exceeded all limits, as the highly wrought up spectators realised that these statements, if corroborated, destroyed one of the strongest points which had been made by the prosecution."
"More than half the people in the United States are breathing air that could be threatening their health, according to the American Lung Association. The private health group has just released (April 27) its 12th annual State of the Air report, which ranks the quality of the air in U.S. cities and counties in terms of the most common types of air pollution."
"Current therapies to treat prostate cancer, including radiation and removal of the entire gland, can lead to lifelong problems, including erectile dysfunction and incontinence. By comparison, urinary and erectile problems following light therapy resolved within three months, with no significant side effects remaining after two years, according to Emberton."
"An anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend Sherlock Holmes was that, although in his methods of thought he was the neatest and most methodical of mankind, and although also he affected a certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the less in his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a fellow-lodger to distraction."
"NASA’s Parker Solar Probe mission touched the Sun to provide us the first ever direct observations of the solar atmosphere, the corona, as well as traveling by Venus, where it gave scientists the first complete look at Venus’ orbital dust ring, detected a bright rim around the edge of the planet that may be nightglow, and discovered natural radio emission."
"Talking birds, goats butting heads, and a giant tortoise that hangs out with chickens are all part of a living classroom. High-school students at the Career Center in Arlington, Virginia are learning firsthand, and hands-on, how to care for animals. They are at the animal science laboratory, learning about, and taking care of, about 50 species of animals."
"Whether he's teaching first or fifth graders, Mr. Sabbeth strives to make the lessons understandable, while exercising the children's reasoning powers. For instance, he's introduced concepts such as autonomy and the sanctity of life to this 5th grade class. His students also talk about a list of seven ethical principles that all begin with the letter ""C."""
"Since that time the distinction between the two races, the conqueror or Gothic and the Roman or conquered, had almost disappeared, and the men of the north had become confounded with those of midday in a single nation, to whose grandiosity had contributed that with the rough virtues of savage Germania, this with the traditions of Roman culture and polity."
"For many years, Milton Berle remained a funnyman loved by Americans. He produced projects for several media, and collected awards for his work in television. The Television Academy Hall of Fame added him as one of its members. The story of his life led to the nineteen ninety-two film, “Mister Saturday Night.” He also wrote books of jokes and his memories."
"On their way they took Hyccara, a petty Sicanian seaport, nevertheless at war with Egesta, and making slaves of the inhabitants gave up the town to the Egestaeans, some of whose horse had joined them; after which the army proceeded through the territory of the Sicels until it reached Catana, while the fleet sailed along the coast with the slaves on board."
"Nanolasers, they say, need only a small amount of energy to start shining. Instead of using mirrors that reflect light, the team has created a device that traps energy and prevents it from escaping. That power is harnessed and builds into a “strong, well-shaped” beam. Researchers say this overcomes a well-known challenge of nanolasers — “energy leakage.”"
"The weeklong meeting got off to a rocky start. One day after it began, it was temporarily suspended because four members of the committee had tested positive for COVID-19. The talks resumed after a two-day break when new tests apparently indicated the earlier tests were false positives, although those four members attended the talks virtually after that."
"My grandfather went to seek silver, but the silver became Indians. My grandfather went to seek Indians, but the Indians became gold. My grandfather went to seek gold, but the gold became earth. My grandfather went to seek land, but the land became a frontier. My grandfather, still intrigued, went to shape the frontier; and Brazil took the form of a harp."
"Zeldin also said there are many causes for allergies, and people with allergies often are sensitive to more than one weed. His latest research on the subject has shown that environmental and genetic factors play a role as well. And there is evidence of a connection between a pre-disposition to asthma and allergies, and obesity and cardiovascular disease."
"Two hours upstate from the bright lights of Broadway and the bankers of Wall Street is another New York entirely — one with green pastures, open skies, and no shortage of livestock. Small-town voters there may have a big impact this election season, and with just days to go before the state's Republican and Democratic primaries, many are still undecided."
"On a global scale, there is more corruption in the construction trade than in the arms or energy sectors, and Transparency International has found that corruption can be found in every phase of construction—from the preliminary planning stage, to the awarding of contracts, to the employment of subcontractors, to the operation and maintenance of projects."
"Moving from one place to another is always an adventure. No amount of research can prepare you for the surprises you will find in the new place. This is often the case with international students in the United States. Around major American holidays, international students often find themselves in uncharted waters, which they learn to navigate with time."
"And he said to us: Hereby shall I know that you are peaceable men: Leave one of your brethren with me, and take ye necessary provision for your houses, and go your ways, and bring your youngest brother to me, that I may know you are not spies: and you may receive this man again, that is kept in prison: and afterwards may have leave to buy what you will."
"Virtually every city in the United States has been transformed by waves of immigrants over the past two centuries, but perhaps no other American metropolis represents its ethnic diversity as clearly as does Chicago. The Midwestern giant is a hodgepodge of ethnicity, where old, well-rooted communities thrive side-by-side with new immigrant neighborhoods."
"Mark wrote a letter to his wife and gave it to Vassili to take to her, and this was what was in the letter: 'When the bearer of this arrives, take him into the soap factory, and when you pass near the great boiler, push him in. If you don't obey my orders I shall be very angry, for this young man is a bad fellow who is sure to ruin us all if he lives.'"
"This group of musicians from the Andes mountain region of Chile and Peru calls itself Wayno. They play the traditional music of the Andes, using age-old instruments like wooden flutes, guitars, and bells. A variety of musicians, dancers and mimes regularly perform in the subways, playing for tips that help them earn a living while practicing their art."
"But what about reducing pain? Aspirin competes with other medicines for reducing pain and high body temperature. The competition includes acetaminophen, the active substance in products like Tylenol. It also includes ibuprofen, the active substance in products such as Advil. Like ibuprofen, aspirin is an NSAID — a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug."
"“The findings of our study help to explain why previous research has shown that a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular problems like stroke, heart failure and heart attacks,” said professor Philip Eaton, professor of cardiovascular biochemistry at King’s College, in a statement."
"Malcolm's mother was the sister of the Earl of Northumberland. So the son of Duncan was half-English; and he became more than half-English when, somewhat later, he married Margaret, sister of his friend and guest, ""Edgar the Atheling,"" last claimant of the Saxon throne, who had taken refuge with him while vainly plotting against William the Conqueror."
"In a sumptuous conference area at the Ford Foundation headquarters in New York, foundation president Darren Walker told an animated crowd—policymakers and corporate executives as well as NGO representatives and colorfully dressed indigenous leaders from around the world—about his commitment to bring these disparate groups together to save the planet."
"Engineers and scientists have been thrilled with high-resolution pictures sent by Spirit. Project team members are anticipating close-up analysis of rock samples. Brett Lindenfeld of Alliance SpaceSystems helped design and build the robotic arm on the two rovers, which will conduct that analysis, and says he felt exhilarated to see the arm in action."
"In times of crisis it’s usually the most vulnerable members of the community who are most affected; the poor, the sick, the elderly. In these situations, it’s often the efforts of caring individuals and civic-minded businesses that can make a difference. Combine the two, and you get the kind of results that the DC Dream Center has always strived for."
"Carefully conserved though that oxygen is, no process is or can be one hundred per cent efficient. There will be leakage into space, and that which is lost must be replaced. To bring oxygen from Earth in liquid form would be outrageously expensive and even more outrageously inefficient—and no other planet in the System has free oxygen for the taking."
"It was an infinite relief to her to be able to breathe the freer and more generous air of the metropolis (where people scarcely know the names of their next-door neighbours, much less their business, and find enough to do in attending to their own concerns) after having lived for so long a time under the prying eyes of the gossipmongers of Iselford."
"U.S. scientists have found a surprising relationship between obesity and the kind of food digesting bacteria we have in our intestines. As VOA's David McAlary reports, the findings suggest that the microbes living in our guts might influence how prone we are to being overweight and might offer new solutions to the growing obesity epidemic worldwide."
"It is self-evident that these collaborations are helping these young artists, but they are doing something much more. In an increasingly disassociated and global era, this new way of working has created a unique, local phenomenon that enriches the lives of San Francisco music lovers and creates for them and for the artists a true sense of community."
"U.N. Human Rights Office spokesperson Rupert Colville says judges should not be politicized and should not bring politics into the court. Nevertheless, he told VOA, just like everybody else, judges have a right to hold their own opinions and seek membership in associations of their choosing. He noted the new law seriously restricts these activities."
"Tasmanian authorities are intensifying their war against a potentially destructive foe — the European red fox. Officials in the southern Australian state believe their numbers are increasing and are spending up to $50 million to eradicate the foxes. Skeptics, though, think hoaxers may have brought fox carcasses to the island to scare the government."
"Other small sculptures include two hippopotami, on display legless and upside down. Mr. Romano says the ancient Egyptians broke off the legs before putting the figures in the tombs, to keep them from running around the tomb in the afterlife. He says restorers put on new legs, which the staff at the Museum removed for the sake of historical accuracy."
"A Forest Service researcher, working with U.S. and international researchers, analyzed data on pest interceptions on imported cargo from before and after the United States implemented the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No. 15 in the mid-2000s and found that the incidence of live wood-infesting pests fell by as much as 52 percent."
The chemical industry felt threatened. Industry spokesmen and other critics said the book was non-scientific and emotional. They misunderstood the message of the book. Miz Carson did not suggest that all pesticides be banned. She urged that control of these substances be given to biologists who could make informed decisions about the risks involved.
"What sets video streaming apart from other data transfers at the TMC (transportation management center) is that video streaming requires the transfer of significantly more data. The amount of data transferred varies based on the video resolution, compression algorithm, bitrate, etc. but can vary from a few megabytes (MB) to hundreds of MB per frame."
"“The National Archives holds over 15 billion pages of textual records, over 18 million maps, charts and architectural drawings, more than 43 million images, more than 365,000 reels of film and over 110,000 videotapes, to say nothing of the billions of electronic records,” says Meghan Ryan Guthorn, acting deputy chief operating officer of the agency."
"Building upon research by Roger Shepard and Jean-Claude Risset, Deutsch found a way to build a ""staircase"" of musical tones that seems to both go up without end, and just like in Escher's illusion, they appear to never go up to another octave. By changing the harmonics of each tone, Deutsch had in effect, turned a linear musical scale into a circle."
"Conservation through Public Health is also working to educate communities about preventing other illnesses, including Ebola, a deadly hemorrhagic disease spread through touching the blood and eating the meat of an infected animal. She says Ugandans do not usually eat uncooked bush meat but that neighbors from the Democratic Republic of the Congo do."
"This morning, when I went to look at my flowers, surrounded by their white fence, which protects them against the good cattle grazing in the field beyond, I saw again in my mind all that blossoms in the woods, the fields, the gardens, the orangeries and the green-houses, and I thought of all that we owe to the world of marvels which the bees visit."
"I know what you want, said the sea witch. ""It is very stupid of you, but you shall have your way, though it will bring you to sorrow, my pretty princess. You want to get rid of your fish's tail and to have two supports instead, like human beings on earth, so that the young prince may fall in love with you and so that you may have an immortal soul."""
"The webcast included leaders from the United States and the African Union, as well as actors and musicians seeking to solicit donations from organizations and individuals. The effort aims to set the stage for the world to bounce back from the pandemic, addressing issues such as vaccine equity, world hunger, the climate crisis and international aid."
"Bill Gette and Rebecca Schwer are staff members at the Massachusetts Audubon Society, which maintains an education center and bird banding station for the Parker River National Wildlife Refuge here on the Massachusetts coast. In addition to songbirds, the Refuge also shelters endangered shorebirds such as the Piping Plover, varied mammals and fish."
"The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness—a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility."
"As propositions may be true or false, so also opinion or judgment or conception, may be true or false: for opinion or judgment is only the concluding result of deliberation or reflection — and reflection is the silent dialogue of the mind with itself: while conception or phantasy is the coalescence or conjunction of opinion with present perception."
"It may seem wonderful that language, which is the only method of conveying our conceptions, should, at the same time, be an hindrance to our advancement in philosophy; but the wonder ceases when we consider, that it is seldom studied as the vehicle of truth, but is too frequently esteemed for its own sake, independent of its connection with things."
"On an October day—a sunny day, and except for the yellow leaves that quivered on rapidly bearing branches, very like spring—Patricia Everett, from the window of her home, watched an automobile drive out of sight, carrying her mother and sister away to Florida, and confided to the empty room that she was the very unhappiest girl in the whole world!"
"Then the merry little boys they will ramble, / So gleesome, o’er mountain and dale, / Where the sweets of the rose through the bramble / Will be blown by the mild summer gale: / Then a share of Nature’s smiles each morning / To the poor humble peasant will be given. / While the lark from his covert he is soaring, / His musical notes to the heaven."
"Certain jurisdictions, particularly in Europe, are considering regulations intended to address the issue of ""overtourism,"" including by restricting access to city centers or popular tourist destinations or limiting accommodation offerings in surrounding areas, such as by restricting construction of new hotels or the renting of homes or apartments."
"We seem to be transported, as in a dream, to the vines, and orange-groves, and cloudless skies of Greece, and the wearied spirit abandons itself for a while to the soft influences of the azure heaven, the countless luxuriance of roses, the undulating forms of the fair girls dancing in the shade, while youthful attendants brim the beaker with wine."
"Mr. Bronstone says the mere fact barges are available keeps the costs of truck and rail transport competitive. Although barge traffic is slower, the vessels carry 15 times more than the average rail car and 60 times more than a tractor-trailer truck. A rise or decline in barge traffic could have a significant impact on the nation's highway system."
"The spiritual journey does not consist of arriving at a new destination where a person gains what he did not have, or becomes what he is not. It consists in the dissipation of one's own ignorance concerning one's self and life, and gradual growth of that understanding, which begins a spiritual awakening. The finding of God is coming to one's self."
"Fossett once said that he was most proud of being the first person to fly around the world alone in a hot-air balloon. In nineteen ninety-five he had some practice when he became the first person to fly alone in a hot-air balloon across the Pacific Ocean. To make a trip around the world alone, it was necessary to have an improved autopilot device."
"And the protesters across the globe appear to be combining smartly offline and online tools, copying each other, even street opponents, feeding on a new era of anger, in which losers even in countries that hold fair elections are not prepared to accept the results and winners demand all too often total obeisance from those vanquished at the polls."
"Panama's National Environmental Authority requires that for each hectare of forest affected by the Canal expansion project, two hectares be reforested. Displaced wildlife has been rescued and relocated. And the new lock systems will allow canal operators to recycle 60 percent more of the canal's fresh lakewater than is possible with today's locks."
"One of the challenges to designing prosthetics, or exoskeletons for the disabled, is that everyone is different. Technology designed to help a person walk or get around doesn't work very well when it is built to be one-size-fits-all. But scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have figured out a quick, easy way to make each prosthetic different."
This new way of observing neutrino oscillation is the key for scientists to be able to make measurements that would allow them to distinguish the different oscillations of neutrinos and its anti-particle counterpart anti-neutrinos. This is something that could help in better understanding the physical processes that involve matter and antimatter.
"The FDA called Lyrica an important development in the fight against the disease and a reason for hope in patients. At the same time, the agency said it is not known why Lyrica works. It also said that not everyone who took the drug was helped. Lyrica causes side-effects in some patients, including problems with mental concentration and attention."
"Phil Pfister is the only American to be named one of the World's top five Strong Men since 1990. Though he's placed well in numerous contests, including winning the American Hercules 2000, and coming in second at this year's ""Beauty and the Beast"" contest, he isn't getting rich off the prize money. His winnings have averaged about $15,000 a year."
"In 2009, Spirit, one of NASA's two Mars rovers, got stuck in the sand. And more recently, the other rover — Curiosity — had to take a detour to avoid the shifting sands of the red planet. This got some scientists to thinking about ways to keep our very expensive robotic probes from getting sidelined by something as inconsequential as a sand trap."
"Scientists say the mass emergence is key to the insects’ survival — there are too many for predators to eat all of them — and it usually happens at dusk. Once out of the ground, the cicadas molt and wait for their bodies to dry and harden, then they fly to the tops of trees where they feed and look for a mate, which they do by making a loud buzz."
"Ms. Martinez says the tidal wave spawned by the quake reached as far away as Somalia's coastline, but in a much-weakened form. A series of aftershocks have been recorded, including one registering 7.3 on the Richter scale that jolted parts of Bangladesh. Minor aftershocks have been detected as far away as the U.S. states of Alaska and California."
"During its mission, the probes circled the moon, making measurements of its gravity. Scientists from MIT and the University of Paris used this data to generate a highly detailed map of the moon’s crust, showing areas where the crust thickens and thins. In general, the group observed that the moon’s near side has a thinner crust than its far side."
"The roses out on the roof were in full bloom, and peeped in at the window; and there stood the little chairs, on which they had sat when children; and Kay and Gerda seated themselves each on their own chair, and held each other by the hand, while the cold empty grandeur of the Snow Queen's palace vanished from their memories like a painful dream."
"My love is like a spring among the hills whose brimming waters may not be confined, but pour one torrent through the ways that wind down to a garden; there the rose distills its nectar; there a tall, white lily fills night with anointing of two lovers, blind, dumb, deaf, of body, spirit, and of mind from breathless blending of far-sundered wills."
"The premise of Numb3rs, a CBS-TV series that premiered in 2005, is simple: two brothers, one a seasoned cop, the other a genius mathematician, team up to solve crimes in modern-day Los Angeles. Keith Devlin, a professor of mathematics at Stanford University, was immediately attracted to this idea, and not just because the hero is a mathematician."
"If the passenger's journey involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Warsaw convention and the Montreal convention may be applicable, and these conventions govern, and, in most cases, limit the liability of carriers for death or personal injury and with respect to loss of or damage to baggage."
"Sounding like a miniature jackhammer in overdrive, a quiet morning’s peace is suddenly interrupted by bursts of loud, rapid tapping. It doesn’t take long, however, to realize that the intense and precise tapping is actually the sound of a woodpecker using his beak to search for his breakfast — usually insects or tree sap — in a neighboring tree."
"By far, most land owned by the federal government is in the American West. The feds own almost 47 percent of the 11 coterminous Western states, which include California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington State, Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah. The U.S. government owns a whopping 85 percent of land in the state of Nevada."
The soil stores moisture during cooler weather. But most of that moisture is gone by the middle or end of the hottest months of the year. Trees and other plants can look thirsty. Leaves can become droopy and hang downward. They can also turn yellow. Yellowing can be a sign of too much water. But it can also be a warning sign of too little water.
"Salmon and steelhead start their lives in freshwater streams and tributaries. They then migrate downstream, rearing and maturing, before they reach the ocean. They live in the ocean for 2 to 5 years, migrating thousands of miles, before beginning the journey upstream to their natal streams where they spawn to produce the next generation of fish."
"The Potomac has been called the wildest urban landscape in the world. In some places it is flat and broad and so clear that you can see all the way down to the rocks and sand on the bottom. In others it is thick with gardens of aquatic vegetation with native species like wild celery, curly pondweed and stargrass, and exotic plants like hydrilla."
"Everybody is fighting each other under the illusion that it is the ""other people"" that are causing the problem. We don't realize that we are all in the same boat. We are all suffering from the absence of a system that can pull us together and assure us that the results of each person's work will come back to him and enhance his life in some way."
"A4AI, which is backed by 30 companies and organizations such as tech titans Google, Microsoft and Facebook as well as the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of State and the UK Department for International Development, wants to help broadband Internet access prices fall to below 5 percent of monthly worldwide income."
"He, too, had said, in vibrating tones, that he loved her. He had begged her to give him a chance; implored that she would let him try to be worthy. As if, poor fellow, he ever could come up to her standard! What girl of her breeding would think of him twice when there were blue-blooded, perfectly-groomed Greek gods like Tony Severance on earth?"
"So, too, in his descriptions of the Elysian Fields and of Tartarus, Virgil simply reproduces in substance the many similar descriptions which occur in the Greek poets and philosophers; and although he perfects these with many exquisite touches of his own, such original contributions of his belong rather to the domain of art than of eschatology."
"The new research provides the first solid evidence that the universe went through an extraordinary growth spurt in its first brief moments of being, a period called inflation. This unfathomably rapid rate of growth left ripples in the fabric of space—gravitational waves that Albert Einstein predicted, but that had never been detected until now."
"Last year, more than 26,000 people attended the D.C. Environmental Film Festival during its two-week run, taking in not just the movies but also lectures by renowned scientists and discussions with filmmakers. With rising public concerns about climate change and the environment, festival planners are hoping for an even bigger turnout this year."
"First, it is my desire to give expression to that rational view of the world which is being forced upon us with such logical rigour by the modern advancements in our knowledge of nature as a unity, a view in reality held by almost all unprejudiced and thinking men of science, although but few have the courage (or the need) to declare it openly."
"From Florence, in March of this same year, our master made his way to Perugia, where he drew the balance of his pay for the Sistine frescoes; and then, prudently avoiding Orvieto, went on south to Rome, where we have seen that Pinturicchio had now established himself, together with the Florentine Filippino Lippi, and had found many commissions."
"The insect collectors and students who occupy themselves with the magnificent butterflies and larger moths (of which there is an enormous variety of kinds) refuse to deal with the somewhat dull-looking and almost innumerable minute moths which are classed as Micro-lepidoptera, in contrast to the Macro-lepidoptera (or big moths and butterflies)."
"All things are implicated with one another, and the bond is holy; and there is hardly anything unconnected with any other things. For things have been co-ordinated, and they combine to make up the same universe. For there is one universe made up of all things, and one god who pervades all things, and one substance, and one law, and one reason."
"Ms. Trosper says Spirit's operators are extending its instrument arm to brush the Martian dust from Adirondack, get close-up images with its microscope camera, and determine the rock's mineral content with an infrared sensor. She notes that they will use an abrasion tool Tuesday to scratch below its surface before moving on to its next target."
This was Pillay’s final annual report to the U.N. Council before stepping down as High Commissioner for Human Rights in August. She reflected with pride upon the accomplishments of her office during her six-year tenure. But expressed sorrow for the many challenges and implacable brutality that cause so much grievous suffering around the world.
"The concept of superspreading is not new and played a role in the SARS epidemic in Asia in 2002–03. The Washington Post reported that one man admitted to a hospital infected 156 clinical staff and visitors. The disease, marked by trouble breathing, high fever and cough, was responsible for 40 percent of deaths in more than two dozen countries."
"Tierney Sutton began singing in musical theatre and conservatory choirs in her native Wisconsin. It was years later, while majoring in Russian at Wesleyan University in Illinois, that she first discovered jazz. A semi-finalist in the Thelonious Monk Jazz Vocal Competition, she released her first solo album, Introducing Tierney Sutton, in 1999."
"Nearly one half of the north side of this street was occupied by the churchyard and church; the remaining portion, as well as the opposite side of the way, being composed of small low, two-story cottages with thatched roofs (and most of them having little projecting dormer-windows), a couple of public-houses, and a small grocery establishment."
"Local farmers tried other remedies first: garlic sauce and Worcestershire sauce. But apparently nothing keeps the rabbits and rodents away quite like Tabasco. So far, it has been used on lettuce, green beans, barley and wheat, with tests under way on young apple and cherry trees. It takes about five small bottles to spray one hectare of crops."
"NASA scientists said on Tuesday that the Phoenix Mars Lander has detected the apparent presence of a chemically reactive salt called perchlorate in the Martian soil. Perchlorate is a toxic material that's used in rocket fuel, but the scientists said its presence doesn't lessen the possibility that Mars has or once had some kind of life on it."
The doctor was Lawrence Craven. He observed unusual bleeding among children who chewed an aspirin gum to ease pain after a throat operation. Doctor Craven believed they were bleeding because aspirin prevented the blood from thickening or clotting. He decided that aspirin might help prevent heart attacks caused by blood clots in blood vessels.
"Tens of thousands of people are flocking to Houston's annual Livestock Show and Rodeo, the biggest event of its kind in the world. The main attraction is the rodeo, where cowboys ride bucking horses and compete in other contests drawn from ranch life. A new event this year connects visitors with the cowboys of the Old West depicted in movies."
"The swifts and the swallows told their feathered friends all about it, and they told others, both birds and animals, until at last it began to be rumored through all the animal world that on one day in the year the children of men were made wonderfully happy by means of some sort of a festival which they held about a fir-tree from the forest."
"It was an exciting moment when the penny dropped, and we realized that the two different song types from plain-backed thrushes that we first heard in northeast India in 2009, and which were associated with different habitats at different elevations, were given by two different species, said Per Alstrom of Uppsala University, who led the team."
"Encyclopedias have been around in one form or another for thousands of years. But in recent years competitors have emerged to challenge the traditional printed encyclopedia. First there were versions on compact disks and now they're online. While there may be lots of encyclopedias on the Internet, perhaps one of the most unusual is Wikipedia."
"In the deepest spot of all stands the castle of the Sea King. Its walls are built of coral, and the long Gothic windows are of the clearest amber. The roof is formed of shells that open and close as the water flows over them. Their appearance is very beautiful, for in each lies a glittering pearl which would be fit for the diadem of a queen."
"NASA officials have been reorganizing the agency to meet the deadline while continuing to build the International Space Station and operate the space shuttle until 2010. It is like a two front war, and to make things harder, they must work without budget increases for the additional program. Scott Horowitz calls the effort a grand challenge."
"Even in the choice and use of the finest works of fiction, the greatest caution is necessary. The little one can hardly distinguish between a fable that amuses it, and a lie told to shield it from punishment. If it hear nothing but truth, it will know nothing but truth; and a truthful mind is a glorious thing to behold in children as in men."
"Gut bacteria break down soluble fiber, which includes pectin from apples, berries and citrus, into short chain fatty acids. Marsland says the fatty acids interact with spongy tissue inside the bones, where protective immune cells are produced, and help quiet immune system overactivity. An overzealous immune reaction can lead to inflammation."
"The mystical school of Yogis was established by Patanjali, the founder of one of the six philosophical systems of ancient India. It is supposed that the Neo-platonists of the second and third Alexandrian Schools were the followers of Indian Yogis, more especially was their theurgy brought from India by Pythagoras, according to the tradition."
"Christine Lambert, head of France’s national union of farmers, said, “Due to the closure of the Schengen borders, but also to movement restrictions in Europe, the Poles and Romanians who used to come, won’t anymore. If our call is not heard, the production will remain in the fields and the entire fruit and vegetable sector will be damaged.”"
"Valid concerns have been raised about how these factors and constraints may be eroding the genetic integrity and the wild character of bison that, for millennia, were shaped into resilient animals by the hands of natural selection and wide-ranging movements across large landscapes that allowed for natural dispersal and intermixing of herds."
"The Northern Mockingbird is a common sighting. They live everywhere in the continental United States year-round. They are also present in most of Mexico. This species is not migratory. They can thrive in a variety of habitats which contribute to their success as a species. Shrubland, deserts, and even lawns are suitable for the Mockingbird."
"An international team of scientists has sequenced the complete genome of the woolly mammoth. Led by the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm, the work opens the door to recreate the huge herbivore, which last roamed the Earth 4,000 years ago. VOA’s Rosanne Skirble considers the science of de-extinction and its place on the planet."
"Aspirin does not help everything, however. It can cause problems, like an increased danger of stomach bleeding and ulcers. And it can interfere with other medicines. Also, some people should not take aspirin. These include people who take other blood thinners or have bleeding disorders. Pregnant women are usually also told to avoid aspirin."
"But good AEneas, pondering through the night / distracting thoughts and many an anxious care, / resolved, when daybreak brought the gladsome light, / to search the coast, and back sure tidings bear, / what land was this, what habitants were there, / if man or beast, for, far as the eye could rove, / a wilderness the region seemed, and bare."
"But many people choose a different approach to dealing with hair loss. One of them is a transplant. Dr. Robert Bernstein, associate professor of dermatology at Columbia University in New York, says that this surgical procedure has been perfected to the degree that people cannot tell the difference between transplanted hair and natural hair."
"The government’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority granted approval Wednesday for the vaccine, which Pfizer developed along with Germany’s BioNTech. The first vaccinations will begin next week, with staffers of the Britain’s National Health Service, nursing home residents and staffers expected to receive first priority."
"Cheese-lover Pujeh had registered as a judge so that he could enter two parts of the competition. In one, amateur and professional cooks fired up their grills to feed throngs of hungry judges. In the other, visitors received free cheese from corporate sponsors and small businesses while they enjoy performances on the festival's large stage."
"How did you like that, dear friend, said Tom with a smile, ""this checkmate that I gave you with my queen?"" - Mary was shocked at first. Would she have missed something? But she soon smiled too and replied, ""Well, what would you think if I captured your queen with my knight?"" And having moved the knight, she removed the queen from the board."
"Meanwhile, physicians who work in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, continue giving testimony about the travails of people who desperately want help. They talk about sickly, frail people walking for miles through war zones, through crocodile-infested waters, through monsoons, to clinics where there may or may not be the treatment they need."
"Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality."
"The narwhal is an odontocete or toothed whale, but is different from all other toothed whales in that it has no teeth in its mouth. Instead, male narwhals have a single long, straight tooth (or tusk) that protrudes two to three meters out of the upper left jaw. Females almost never have a tusk. The tooth grows in a counterclockwise spiral."
"They found that those who breast-fed had a 9 percent lower risk of heart disease and an 8 percent decreased risk of stroke, compared with women who had never nursed. The benefit was even greater for women who breast-fed their babies for two years or more. Their heart disease risk was 18 percent lower and the risk of stroke 17 percent less."
"This collection, which I commend to the notice of the Folk-Lore Society, is very curious and original, abounding as it does in extraordinarily bizarre and beautiful variants of the best-known fairy tales, a very natural result of the peculiar combination in Roumanian of such heterogeneous elements as Romance, Slavonic, Magyar, and Turkish."
"Climate change has a broad impact on health, both through the direct effect that climate change has on extreme weather—heat waves to heavy rainfall events and associated flooding, coastal storms, hurricanes—but also indirectly, in the way that it alters disease ecology, or ecosystems that are important in maintaining a healthy environment."
"Today we visit three current exhibits in Washington D.C. Two of the exhibits are in the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History. Both shows mark the thirtieth anniversary of the first official report about the disease AIDS. A third exhibit, at the Textile Museum, explores the importance and meaning of the color green."
"A man was crouching at the window. I could see little of him, for he was gone like a flash. He was wrapped in some sort of cloak which came across the lower part of his face. One thing only I am sure of, and that is that he had some weapon in his hand. It looked to me like a long knife. I distinctly saw the gleam of it as he turned to run."
"Over an eight year follow-up period, almost one-half of federal offenders released in 2005 (49.3%) were rearrested for a new crime or rearrested for a violation of supervision conditions. Almost one-third (31.7%) of the offenders were also reconvicted, and one-quarter (24.6%) of the offenders were reincarcerated over the same study period."
"Kraus led a study involving 18 musicians and 19 non-musicians, between the ages of 45 and 65, that tested their ability to discern speech from background noise. Researchers also tested how well they remembered what they heard and what they saw, and how quickly they understood what they heard, all important skills for playing an instrument."
"For millennia, Somalilanders have risked their lives to harvest sap of the frankincense tree for international export to be used in churches, French perfumes and cosmetics. Frankincense grows wild in the Cal Madow Mountains of Somaliland's Sanaag region, but the old trade is under threat as trees die from increased demand for their resin."
"Spanish history is replete with official anti-Semitism: the 14th-century massacres of Jews in Seville, Córdoba and elsewhere, incited by a prominent Catholic clergyman; the Spanish Inquisition and forced religious conversions, beginning in the 15th century; and the expulsion of an estimated 70,000 Jews by decree of Ferdinand and Isabella."
"Increasingly, magazines like Seventeen and CosmoGirl! have been featuring young ladies who are overweight, or short, or have big noses or small eyes. The message is that girls like this are beautiful, too — and teenagers seem to be listening. In the last two years, Seventeen magazine has increased its newsstand sales by seventeen percent."
"Halley's Comet shower is the most spectacular for viewers in the southern hemisphere. It is best seen from Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America, where gazers may see as many as 40 ""falling stars"" in the sky. But northern viewers can admire the radiant show above the horizon in predawn hours, away from city lights or moonlight."
"When the balloon pops, after several hours of ascent, a parachute attached to the ozonesonde is deployed, and additional readings of the ozone profile are taken during its descent. With both ascent and descent profiles of the ozone distribution, we are able to accurately describe the shape and size of the ozone hole on a day-by-day basis."
"Lina Khan, 32, a professor at Columbia Law School prior to her nomination, is known for advocating a hard-nosed approach to the regulation of large technology firms like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple. She was nominated to fill an open seat on the FTC in March, and on Tuesday she was confirmed in a bipartisan 69‒28 vote in the Senate."
"Every year, hundreds of thousands of people flock to Washington in the spring to see the cherry blossoms bloom. The buds on the trees can survive chilly temperatures but need warm days to burst open with their white or pink flowers. But because of fluctuating spring temperatures, it is not always easy to predict when the trees will bloom."
"She tended cattle and she sang so sweetly that the herds were delighted with her song, and she needed neither the crook nor the goad to manage them; they obeyed her voice, and gazed at and listened to the maid as she sat under the shade of a pine tree, crowned with a garland of its leaves and singing the loves of Pan and Pitys the Nymph."
"Both the Spanish and the French had a major influence on New Orleans cuisine, but it was the French settlers who introduced the beignet. The square pastry is fried dough that has been sprinkled with powdered sugar. Quite like an American doughnut, but less filling. Locals enjoy the delicacy with cafe au lait, or coffee with steamed milk."
"In a like case the modern scholar encounters an even greater danger, because in the detailed investigation of manifold subjects, he runs the risk of scattering his energies and of losing himself in disconnected knowledge, without supplementing the incomplete, as the ancients succeeded in doing, by the completeness of his own personality."
"Experts say no company has put barcode technology to better use than Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas. By nineteen eighty-eight, all Wal-Mart stores used laser bar code scanners. Highly detailed records on its products, and how they were selling, helped Wal-Mart keep costs down. Today, Wal-Mart is the world’s biggest corporation."
"Nothing of major concern has been discovered. Speaking with reporters, Flight Director Tony Ceccacci said the images do show a white splotchy area on Discovery's right wing. But Ceccacci noted that he and other inspectors spotted the discoloration nearly three weeks earlier — and concluded it was most likely the result of bird droppings."
"Catch Me If You Can is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale who, as a teenager, led authorities on a merry chase as he impersonated professionals from airline pilot to doctor and lawyer. Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent on his trail; Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Abagnale and says he appreciates audience and critical reaction to his work."
"The beautiful simplicity and naivete of the man’s character, the mean circumstances in which his life was cast, the fortitude, industry, and manliness with which he triumphed over his difficulties—these things explain much that seems at first sight futile in his art and colour even his worst failures with a glow of purely human sympathy."
"He celebrated it by publishing in his magazine, ""La Revue de Paris,"" an article in my honor, in which, after the usual reserves, and after declaring war upon my doctrines, he vowed my prose to be ""fascinating,"" and complained of being so bewitched as to believe, at times, that he was converted to the cause of the throne and of the altar."
"The Vice-Consul obligingly expressed his regret for the unpleasant scene of the preceding evening; he did not dissemble his apprehensions for me, in case I continued long in my present situation, but could devise no means for my escape; I was still more perplexed, as without his assistance I should find it impossible to quit the country."
"Considering the size of the Chesapeake Bay which sprawls through six states and Washington, DC, Judy says, much more needs to be done. The Marylanders Grow Oysters program is part of a larger coordinated recovery strategy, including research, monitoring and public programs. Judy says the end game is the same: to jump start Mother Nature."
"A jingle of tinkling bells mingled with the squeak of a viola; the guffaws of a rompish company blended with the tuneless chanting of discordant minstrels, and the gray parrot in its golden cage, suspended from one of the oaken beams of the ceiling, shook its feathers for the twentieth time and screamed vindictively at the roguish band."
"More than 2,000 years old, this statue is one of the clay cavalrymen who once guarded the tomb of China's first emperor, Qin Shihuangdi. The warrior and his horse now stand at the entrance to the National Geographic Museum in Washington, and are among the largest number of Chinese terra-cotta figures ever to travel to the United States."
"The skin gets its oil, called sebum, from the sebaceous glands. Each gland connects to a passage of extremely small hairs. The sebum travels through these passages. The oil reaches the surface of the skin through little holes, called pores. Sometimes, the sebum, hair and cells of the pores block these openings. This is how acne starts."
"The variety that has proven deadly to infected humans, H5N1 virus, primarily infects poultry, but public-health authorities have long warned that a further mutation or alteration of the structure of the virus could produce a strain that could spread easily from human to human, and thus pose the potential threat of a worldwide pandemic."
"The Chihuahuan Desert is the largest ecosystem in the park. Eighty percent of the park is desert. Animals like jackrabbits, roadrunner birds and mule deer live in the Chihuahuan. Many cactus and yucca species thrive. These are succulent plants. Most succulents have thick, heavy leaves that store water. Cacti store water in their stems."
The Great Elephant Census was funded by Paul G. Allen’s Vulcan Inc. and supported by The Nature Conservancy. It was initially launched in 2013 across Africa where researchers used a standardized method of data collection to create an up-to-date picture of the status of African elephants. The Zambia elephant survey completes the census.
"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was once known as an industrial city where the skies were blackened with emissions from the steel mills that drove the local economy. But when world leaders gather there September 24 and 25 for their economic summit, they will find a city that has moved to the fore in environmental and energy saving technology."
Many scientists believe that Einstein's model of gravity and space-time will sooner or later be proved invalid under extreme conditions. And physicists are hoping that they will someday find an alternative description of gravity that can mesh both relativity and quantum physics and finally explain what now seem to be incompatibilities.
"The American Museum of Natural History in New York City is famous for its immense collection of fossilized dinosaurs and other long-dead scientific specimens. But at the Butterfly Conservatory within the museum, over 500 species of gorgeously colored living animals can be found flapping around and feeding in an idyllic tropical garden."
"The inaugural exhibit at the new Loyola University Museum of Art in Chicago is raising questions about art and the value of copies of art. The show features early 17th century Italian painter Caravaggio, but has none of his original paintings on display. Instead, the exhibit consists entirely of high-quality reproductions of his works."
"Cancer treatments and strong painkillers like morphine can also cause itchiness. Yet effective treatments for severe itching are limited. This is partly because scientists have traditionally thought that an itch was a less intense form of pain. Because of this, Professor Chen says itch research has lived in the shadow of pain research."
"The U.S. Women's Soccer team has won a medal at every Olympics since the sport was introduced at the 1996 Atlanta games. The Americans won gold in Atlanta, silver at Sydney in 2000, and reclaimed the gold at Athens in 2004. But after underachieving at last year's Women's World Cup, changes were made to prepare for the Beijing Olympics."
"Well, in the first place, I don't think my ideal would speak like that, said she. ""He would be a harder, sterner man, not so ready to adapt himself to a silly girl's whim. But, above all, he must be a man who could do, who could act, who would look Death in the face and have no fear of him—a man of great deeds and strange experiences."""
"Over the past three decades, the study found, the burden of hypertension has shifted from wealthy nations to low-and-middle-income countries. Majid Ezzati, professor of global environmental health at Imperial College London, said that while hypertension has decreased in wealthy nations, it has increased in many of the poorer countries."
"In Babylonia the sacred tree was no doubt closely associated with Istar, the divine mother, who was originally not a Semitic, but an Accadian goddess, and whose cult, together with that of her bridegroom Tammuz, was introduced into Chaldaea from Eridu, a city which flourished on the shores of the Persian Gulf between 3000 and 4000 B.C."
"Researchers from the Pennsylvania State University say that these neutrinos contain energies that are thousands to millions of times greater than those generated by particle colliders/accelerators such as the European Organization for Nuclear Research’s (CERN) Large Hadron Collider, located on the border between France and Switzerland."
"In 1505, Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci reportedly produced a large painting, known as the “Battle of Anghiari,” on a wall in Florence’s Palazzo Vecchio. But to the naked eye, no such artwork can be seen there. The location of the mural, which depicts four horsemen in battle, has perplexed art lovers for more than five-hundred years."
"She sat beside the reapers, and they passed her parched grain. She ate, was satisfied, and left some of it. When she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, ""Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don’t reproach her. Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it. Let her glean, and don’t rebuke her."""
"Science has made it possible to harvest energy from the wind, sun and water. All these renewable resources are used today to power an energy-hungry world. But imagine harvesting energy from crowds of people moving to and from work every day. That is one of the possibilities of piezoelectricity, the science of gaining power from motion."
"When Christmas Eve came he’d harness up his reindeers, Dasher, and Prancer, and Vixen, and the rest of them, and wrap himself up in furs, and light his big pipe, and cram his sled full of the doll-babies and Noah’s arks, and all the other toys he’d been making, and off he’d go with a great shout and tremendous ringing of sleigh-bells."
"Every step towards organization raises a crop of vices peculiar to itself, fresh developments of the egotism and greed and vanity of those into whose hands there falls control, fresh instances of that hostile pedantry which seems so natural to officials and managers, insurgencies and obstinacies and suspicions on the part of everyone."
"Since the drug company had selected only favourable or neutral research reports to submit to the government for approval, and had failed to disclose any data from those studies which had shown the experimental drug to be harmful, the company was perceived to be unethical, and many lawyers believed that lawsuits were now in the offing."
"Then, this child of fourteen years learned, as in a homework, that which we hide to maidens until their wedding night. She flipped through the drawings of the anatomy book, those superb drawings of a bloody reality. She paused upon each organ, understanding the most secret of them, those upon which is built the shame of men and women."
"The youth, caked in dust, was fitted with a neck brace before he was carried away on a stretcher and raced to a field hospital. But health care workers said he had suffered only minor cuts and bruises. The boy said he stayed alive by eating a jar of ghee, clarified butter, that he found in the darkness of the debris he was trapped in."
"The MUTATION prototype newsgroup was established to enhance the rate of transfer of mutation technology and Human Genome Project findings to clinical and research problems. Mutation in any organism, environmental mutagenesis, and mutation mechanisms are discussed, including new mutation-detection technologies, databases, and problems."
"The world is horrible. I'm ditching it and moving to another planet. I'll found a colony where everything will be just perfect, a real utopia. I'll tell everybody what to do (for their own good and the good of the colony, of course) and they'll do it. Or else. But all for the prosperity and well-being of the colonists. You understand."
"The study was the work of researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Massachusetts. Lead researcher Sharon Curhan noted that NSAIDs may reduce blood flow to the cochlea, the hearing organ, and affect its ability. She noted that while such medicines can be purchased without a doctor’s order, they still carry possible side effects."
"The Green Revolution, which got underway in the 1960s, is the most well-known example of how technological advances led to the development of high-yield crops that dramatically boosted farm production. Harvests of rice, wheat and corn increased substantially because of improved seed varieties and the use of fertilizer and pesticides."
"Across a locked-down France, strawberries, lettuce and asparagus are ripening, near-ready for picking. Other plants are poking through the warming soil, thanks to rising temperatures and generous sunshine. But the tens of thousands of Polish, Romanian and Moroccan workers who normally flood in for spring harvest are nowhere in sight."
"In a recent real-world test of the technique, scientists used arrays of laser sensors to exchange data with a NASA spacecraft orbiting the moon at a rate six times faster than the best radio communications available. Researchers say the laser-based system weighs half as much as comparable radio devices and uses 25 percent less power."
"I am studying 31 languages because I want to know better the world in which I live. This helps me avoid, for example, reading faulty translations. It also helps me communicate with my friends in their native languages, seeing that some of them don't speak English or, if they do, are unable to express what they actually feel or think."
"To decipher the ancient inscriptions in this simple character, found upon rocks and monuments, is an object, at this day, of learned research; and its importance may be judged of by observing, that, whenever successfully effected, it is a literal restoration, to the present age, of the lost sounds of those parts of the ancient world."
"A reddish-orange substance is settling out of the water and building up at the bottom of the canals. Larry Tuttle with the Center for Environmental Equity says these are heavy metals that were dissolved in the water. The water running over the reddish-orange stuff looks clean enough, but Mr. Tuttle says you wouldn't want to drink it."
"It is just possible that in this last and latest time a newborn strong and growing sentiment will come to the rescue, will prompt us to seek out and preserve the last remnant, just as long-belated appreciation came at final stance to save for later generations the Great Sequoia Tree, when man's blind avarice had all but wiped it out."
"As we discussed previously, Algeria lived through one do-or-die moment against South Korea in group play. Today, they’ll hope to live through another as they take on Russia. If Les Fennecs can win, they’ll move on to the knockout stage along with Belgium. But if they lose, Russia advances. Watch the action live at 4 PM ET (8 PM UTC)."
"A hundred and fifty feet from this pueblo is a large upright block of sandstone, which is said to be used as a datum point in the observations of the sun made by a priest of Zuñi for the regulation of the time for planting and harvesting, for determining the new year, and for fixing the dates of certain other ceremonial observances."
"Until recently, the last time anyone in Harpers Ferry heard the call of a peregrine falcon, was fifty years ago. This crow-sized raptor, whose natural range is the rugged coastal areas in North America, was nearly decimated by the pesticide DDT. Since the toxin was banned in 1972, the peregrine has made a slow but dramatic recovery."
"The destruction of forests and bad land-use decisions contribute to nearly one-fourth of the world's greenhouse-gas emissions, which scientists blame for climate change, Kerry said. He thanked the Norwegian parliament for unanimously ratifying the Paris agreement Wednesday, and predicted the U.S. Senate will soon follow that course."
"Many women are unable to conceive because of a condition known as polycystic ovary syndrome, in which the ovaries fail to secrete enough hormones to stimulate egg production. Injury to the ovaries caused by radiation or surgery also can interfere with a woman’s ability to produce enough viable eggs, or oocytes, to achieve pregnancy."
"But wind energy developers, in California and West Virginia, are being sued by environmental groups. A growing number of groups contend that hundreds of thousands of birds and bats are being killed every year by wind turbines, mostly at night when bats and migratory birds fly around mountain ridges where many wind farms are located."
The particle lies at the heart of the fundamental question of why there is mass in the universe. Finding the Higgs boson would be one of the biggest scientific advances in more than half-a-century. It would confirm the Standard Model’s description of how subatomic particles interact to form the basic building blocks of the universe.
"Fibonacci Day is celebrated on November 23rd. This date corresponds to the first numbers (1123) of the famous Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The day is a tribute to the mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci, who introduced this sequence, fundamental in various areas of mathematics and nature."
"Every state along the way has its memorable places — an unbelievable view here, a lean-to shelter there, a small town where people take in hikers and cheer them on. Some who attempt the grueling hike imagine long stretches of solitude, but they rarely find them. That's because chatty day hikers pop onto the trail all along the way."
"Oxalic acid, or ""oxalate,"" is a naturally occurring plant chemical which, in the human diet, can react with calcium, iron, and other minerals to inhibit mineral absorption. Foods such as tea, beets, rhubarb, strawberries, spinach, and chocolate are known to increase oxalate in the urine and may contribute to kidney stone formation."
"University of Rochester neonatologist Sanjiv Amin explains that late in pregnancy, a process known as myelination occurs in the brain and nervous system. It's how the brain creates its wiring. Iron is important for myelination, and without it being provided during that period, then myelination may not occur adequately or optimally."
"The Blue Point oyster is returning to the Great South Bay of New York after almost disappearing from the world marketplace. Over-farming, pollution and Hurricane Sandy had severely damaged the Blue Point oyster business. Now, the population is growing in its home on the coast of Long Island, about 100 kilometers from New York City."
"Football can be the ticket out of the grinding poverty of neighborhoods like Tavares Bastos, a poor community built on a hill overlooking Rio de Janeiro’s famous Flamengo beach. Jogo Bonito, as the game is often called, is part of life for residents of this favela, where most people work for minimum wage or in the informal economy."
"Azerbaijan's citizens were asked to vote on more than 30 proposed amendments to the 1995 constitution. The changes include allowing a president to be elected by a simple majority, rather than two-thirds of the vote and eliminating the party list system, in which voters cast ballots for parties in addition to individual candidates."
"Tatoeba is not a language school, nor a forum for academic discussions, nor, much less, a vehicle for propaganda of any kind. It's far above all that. Its true significance will only be perceived, I believe, in a few years or a few decades, when its beneficial influence will have radiated to the most distant corners of the planet."
"And some of the seeds were big flat beans, or little long round beans; and some, like the sweet-peas, were very round, like shot; and some, like the cockscomb seeds, were tiny and shiny and black and so slippery that Prue lost more than she got in her envelope, though she got enough, for there is such a lot of seed on a cockscomb."
"More than thirty years ago, when our knowledge of variation was far less than it is now, Dr. Stejneger had the discernment to interpret Colaptes auratus (Linnaeus), Colaptes cafer (Gmelin), and Colaptes hybridus (Baird) to be dichromatic or trichromatic phases of one species, and not two species that hybridize on a gigantic scale."
"None of the Germanic tribes, who, dividing among themselves the provinces of the Caesarian empire, had tried to dress their barbaric nakedness in the torn but splendid garments of Roman civilization, had known like the Goths how to gather these fragments of purple and gold, to compose themselves in the example of civilized people."
"Because influenza in some countries can circulate year-round, there’s no particular flu season as in more temperate climates. The women were therefore vaccinated at various times with a shot that contained three inactivated flu strains. Each group was followed for up to 180 days to see whether they developed fevers and body aches."
"There's some good news, for a change, in the latest climate forecast from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA scientists say the world's threatened coral reefs, which for decades have been bleaching out and dying off because of climate-induced changes in ocean conditions, might be getting a respite this year."
"A variety of health conditions can rob people of their ability to speak, including stroke, a neuromuscular disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Lou Gehrig’s disease, and locked-in syndrome, in which individuals are completely awake and aware of their surroundings but unable to move or communicate with the outside world."
"Marijuana, also known as cannabis, is now legal in 28 U.S. states for either medical or recreational use. Of those states, four of them legalized recreational marijuana last November, including California. At a dispensary in Los Angeles, the experience for customers is more similar to a trip to the winery or high-end retail store."
"Despite having the fourth largest fresh water reserves in the world, officials say more than 400 Chinese cities, including the capital, face severe water shortages. Experts say the shortages are a result of droughts, overexploitation of water resources, increasing pollution, inefficient delivery methods and temperature increases."
"Copley said that by studying the deep-sea vents and their animal colonies, scientists can better understand how marine life disperses and evolves in the deep ocean. He noted that in the coming years, the ecosystem will see an increasing human presence, in the form of deep-sea fishing, oil and gas extraction and mining operations."
"Stories and books are precious not only for creating language and vocabulary, but also for creating children’s imagery, for creating a vision of the world, of others and of oneself. But it's easy to say: ""Tell them a story."" To tell a story, you have to live through it and communicate it, and that’s not within everyone’s ability."
"Yes, it was a sunny day; but for many days before, the sky had been veiled in gloomy clouds; and joyous indeed was it to look up into that blue vault, and see it unobscured by its sombre screen; and my heart fluttered, like a prisoned bird, with its painful longings for an unchecked flight amidst the beautiful creation around me."
"Goldman Sachs, the American financial powerhouse, is trying to factor into its investment decisions and counsel all possible Omicron outcomes — from a worst-case scenario of greater virulence and vaccine-evasion to the nice surprise that the vaccines remain efficacious, and Omicron turns out to be more benign than its forerunner."
"The potential for surprise in the cyber realm will increase in the next year and beyond as billions more digital devices are connected—with relatively little built-in security—and both nation states and malign actors become more emboldened and better equipped in the use of increasingly widespread cyber toolkits, the report said."
"He had been 30 years, or whatever it was, plowing a lonely furrow and finding that, actually, what he was being confronted with were the small compromises — looking the other way, the small corruptions — and that he didn't get the test he wanted to get, so he had become quite disillusioned and quite aggressive, explains Gleeson."
"At the Oregon Medical Laser Center in the western city of Portland, a team of scientists is working on building tissue from proteins found in the human body. Led by cardiologist Kenton Gregory, the researchers are creating biocompatible tissues made of a substance called elastin, a protein that is produced naturally in the body."
"Key takeaways from Johnson’s remarks included that young British men will still be able, post-Brexit, to enjoy wild stag (bachelor) parties in central Europe — something that won’t necessarily reassure the residents of Prague, Budapest or Krakow, who are increasingly irritated by the rowdiness of young vacationing British males."
"While most of the tribes survived, not much is known so far about the welfare of one of the most secluded tribes, the Shompens, whose island took the brunt of the waves. A few members of the tribe have been sighted and even shot arrows at a military helicopter that hovered over their island on a post-tsunami reconnaissance trip."
"In truth, a man who renders everyone their due because he fears the gallows, acts under the sway and compulsion of others, and cannot be called just. But a man who does the same from a knowledge of the true reason for laws and their necessity, acts from a firm purpose and of his own accord, and is therefore properly called just."
"The economy grew four-tenths of a percent in the quarter, reversing the slightly negative growth rate seen in the previous quarter. This is the largest such increase since the second quarter of 2002, and follows encouraging economic figures issued this week from the euro zone's three largest economies: Germany, France and Italy."
"With a candle-making machine and molds, invented in Rwanda, production costs are about two cents per candle. Candles imported from China cost about 10 cents each in Rwanda. So the economic advantages of this low-tech project are clear — and the Institute hopes these candles and other products will easily find a market in Rwanda."
"Since 1963, Indian-born Srinivasa Varadhan has been teaching and conducting research at New York University's prestigious Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, in New York City. This past May, Varadhan won one of mathematics' top honors, the 900-thousand dollar Abel Prize, for his pioneering research in probability theory."
"A precursor to the NIAC program, which began in 1998, was suspended in 2007 after a cost-conscious U.S. Congress ordered a review of its effectiveness. A year later, a national panel of experts recommended that NASA continue investigating advanced concepts. Congress eventually gave the go-ahead to restore the program this year."
The peregrine falcon was removed from the endangered species list a few years ago. Programs to protect the bird are active in many states in rocky coastal areas of the United States. Park Ranger Bill Hebb says their return to former nesting sites at Harpers Ferry has reestablished an important link to America's ecological past.
"For now, it remains to be seen if open source seeds have any economic viability, but the OSSI organizers would be satisfied if the movement provides an alternative to large companies selling patented seeds. In a world facing the daunting challenges of climate change, Kloppenburg said diversity will be key in feeding the planet."
"Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin could not have come from more different backgrounds. Grimmette is from Michigan, where there is heavy ice and snowfall and he helped build a luge track when he was 14. Martin is from Palo Alto California, where the average temperature is between 10 and 20 degrees Celsius and there is no snowfall."
"Tilghman Island is a small community on Maryland's eastern shore. Like many towns along the Chesapeake Bay, it is a haven for people who enjoy tranquility on the waterfront. Take a short boat ride from Tilghman across the open water and you soon arrive at Poplar Island, a strip of land that is even more remote, and uninhabited."
"Lots of people who have heard of Betty Friedan misstate her place in history. She was not a man-hater, not a bra-burner, not a sexual confrontationist, touting the birth-control pill. A suburbanite, wife and mother, she would be forced out of the National Organization for Women, which she co-founded, for being too conservative."
"Unlike with most sports recognized by the International Olympic Committee, where competition can be ""mixed"" (for all, regardless of gender) or accessible only to men or only to women, in chess women can compete in an ""open"" division (including the World Chess Championship) but they also have an exclusively female championship."
"The dozen women Boyle profiles in her book, Defying Gravity: A Celebration of Late Blooming Women, include a homemaker who was elected to the Connecticut House of Representatives at age 48, a 47-year-old breast cancer survivor who discovered an eye for photography, and a medical technician who became an anthropology professor."
"Shimelba is a tidy place. Residents generally live in single-family homes. A host of organizations, from the International Rescue Committee to the U.N. refugee agency and the Ethiopian government, provide food and medical services. There are schools and churches. Some tradespeople and entrepreneurs operate thriving businesses."
"Perceiving that the general effect was gloomy,—so that the airy castle looked like a feudal fortress, or a monastery of the Middle Ages, or a state prison of our own times, rather than the home of pleasure and repose which he intended it to be,—the owner, regardless of expense, resolved to gild the exterior from top to bottom."
Japan's Toshiba Corporation effectively ended the format war over the next-generation DVD players after announcing this week that it would no longer manufacture HD DVD players and recorders. The announcement paves the way for rival Sony Corporation's Blu-ray technology to become the industry standard for high-definition video.
"The 12-minute flight, 100 kilometers to the edge of space and back, was a test of a number of new technologies, including two NASA precision descent and landing sensor systems, which could be used in future landers on the moon and Mars, and are able to intelligently identify and avoid potential hazards on target landing zones."
"More than one billion people in 80 countries are at risk of contracting lymphatic filariasis, known as elephantiasis, which is transmitted by mosquitos infected with parasitic filarial worms. The worms lodge in the lymphatic system, causing accumulations of lymph fluid that lead to massive swellings of limbs, usually the feet."
"The Halloween pet costume craze is spreading globally. Zoher Kapu is vice president of global optimization and data for eBay, the online marketplace. He told the Chicago Tribune that eBay had 1.5 million pet costumes for sale on Oct. 21 out of 800 million items listed. There were 159 million active customers in 200 countries."
"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."
"But experts say even countries without these advantages can learn from Morocco's efforts. Morocco gets a lot of help from international non-governmental organizations. According to Silvio Mariotti, with the WHO's blindness and deafness prevention program, the country's political commitment made these partnerships much easier."
"But to sit there swinging his legs—this did not suffice to satisfy his heart, did not enable him to celebrate his instincts; and suddenly from his thicket of forest trees and greening bushes he began to pour forth a thrilling little tide of song, with the native sweetness of some human linnet unaware of its transcendent gift."
"I have not read it, but someone who has read the book ""On the origin of species"" by Charles Darwin guarantees that he claims that all living beings – plants, insects, reptiles, birds, dinosaurs, whales, man – descend from a common ancestor, from which they evolved, diversifying according to a law he calls ""natural selection""."
"Jaffa’s experiments and observations on the fruitarians and nutarians of California “showed in every case (two women and three children) that though the diet had a low protein and energy value, the subjects were apparently in excellent health and had been so during the five to eight years they had been living in this manner.”"
"Quoting the landscape architects, upon whom devolves the responsibility for this phase of park activities, the reverse of the famous principle used by the ostrich generally is followed, for roads, trails, and buildings all should provide a maximum of scenic view, at the same time being as inconspicuous as possible themselves."
"When your opponent's king, found in the first (or eighth) row, is trapped by its own pawns or pieces, if you can, with the queen or a rook, give it check, even if this initially requires one or two sacrifices, the result of this maneuver will be checkmate. In Brazil, we call this type of play ""hallway mate"", or ""drawer mate""."
"This situation altered in the fifth century A.D., when a Chinese princess married the king of Khotan, an oasis north of the Plain of Tibet. When the princess left her native land and traveled west to her bridegroom, she carried, smuggled in her headdress, silkworm cocoons and the seeds of the mulberry tree on which they feed."
"Every evening, as the sun goes down, thousands of adult bats fly out of the natural entrance of the cave. It can take from twenty minutes to more than two hours for them all to leave. The bats fly to nearby river valleys to feed on night-flying insects. Then, toward morning, they return to the bat cave within Carlsbad Cavern."
"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children."
"No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the greater part of the members are poor and miserable. It is but equity, besides, that they who feed, cloath and lodge the whole body of the people, should have such a share of the produce of their own labour as to be themselves tolerably well fed, cloathed and lodged."
"A black stone captured a white stone and was left with only one liberty after the white stone was removed from the board. On the next move, if a white stone occupied that same spot, now empty, it would capture that black stone, but this was not allowed, because playing such a move would repeat the last position on the board."
"A trepanned skull was also discovered in a Neolithic sepulchre near Crécy-sur-Morin, where lay no less than thirty skeletons, remarkable for the strongly defined section of the tibiae, whilst around were strewn hatchets, flint knives, bones, stilettos and picks of siliceous limestone with handles made of pieces of stag-horn."
"A black stone captured a white stone and was left with only one liberty after the white stone was removed from the board. On the next move, if a white stone occupied that same spot, now empty, it would capture that black stone, but this was not allowed, because playing such a move would repeat the last position on the board."
"Placed on the lips, the hornet’s venom produces no more effect than clear water; but if there is the slightest scratch the pain is atrocious. The viper’s venom is equally harmless as long as it does not mingle with the blood. Courageous experimenters have tasted, swallowed it, and yet afterward were no worse off than before."
"Looking to the past, Diamandis saw that cash prizes often spurred those breakthroughs. For example, in 1927, the American aviator Charles Lindbergh made the world's first non-stop solo flight from New York to Paris, motivated at least in part by the $25,000 prize offered by Raymond Orteig, a wealthy French American hotelier."
"On April 22, 65-year-old Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot will begin a 35-date North American tour. He'll be promoting his 2004 album Harmony, which he released after suffering a near-fatal abdominal hemorrhage in 2002. Lightfoot was in a coma for six weeks following surgery and spent three months in the hospital."
"Plant physiologist Christina Walters is proud of her work at the National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation, where she studies ways to extend the longevity of the Center's massive seed collections. She leads me down long, echoey hallways to the heart of the seed storage lab. I'm soon to discover, it's a frigid heart."
The report finds the discontinuation of ozone-depleting substances has been good for the world climate. This is because many of these substances also are strong greenhouse gases — pollution linked to climate change. But the report shows that some substitutes are themselves strong greenhouse gases that could harm these gains.
"Wombat droppings are helping an industrial town in the Australian state of Tasmania to fight the effects of the global financial crisis. Burnie has been hit by repeated rounds of job cuts but despite the gloom, one local industry is growing rapidly — producing handmade paper out of a material no one else wants — wombat dung."
"A French technology company has created a tiny tracking device to combat poaching. The tracker is smaller, lighter and cheaper than previous methods, such as radio collars. The creators say the technology can also allow those in remote villages to share information on the internet regardless of language or literacy barriers."
"Within the last 20 years for the first time, the total ecological impact has begun to exceed the total biological capacity of the earth, which is basically a definition of unsustainability, which means at some point, these resource-use levels and pollution levels are going to have to come down to a level that is sustainable."
"Choosing Lagarde as the International Monetary Fund's new boss was a foregone conclusion after she won the backing of the IMF's heavyweights — the United States, Russia, China and the Europeans. Hours before the vote, US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner praised what he called her ""exceptional talent and broad experience."""
"New animal illnesses generally originate in invasive species. Zebra mussels that have spread throughout the U.S. Great Lake introduced a type of botulism that has killed some 100,000 birds in the last decade. A fungus spread by the trade in amphibians has led to the extinction of about 120 species of frogs around the world."
"All that day he was ill, and the next day, and the next; and what should become of the cherry-coloured coat? In the tailor's shop in Westgate Street the embroidered silk and satin lay cut out upon the table—one-and-twenty button-holes—and who should come to sew them, when the window was barred, and the door was fast locked?"
"In remarks to royalty, prime ministers, CEOs, and other elites, Schwab said it is time to reinvigorate the global economy, create jobs, and recreate confidence in the future. He said the world is overwhelmed by cynicism and pessimism, and called on members to repair deficiencies in capitalism and restore the social compact."
"President Joe Biden on Thursday visited a small, deindustrialized Ohio steel town to tout his ambitious multi-trillion-dollar proposed spending plan, to announce a $1 billion initiative for environmental cleanup and restoration, and to court voters in a crucial state ahead of this year's tightly contested midterm elections."
"Prime Minister Hun Sen's Cambodian Peoples' Party, or CPP, was in first place with just over 47 percent of the popular vote. The Sam Rainsy Party was second with nearly 22 percent, and the royalist party known as Funcinpec came in third with just under 21 percent. A smattering of small parties picked up the remaining votes."
"And indeed, not only upon that day but during the remainder of their lives, did Daphnis and Chloe lead a pastoral life, gathering together large herds and flocks, paying especial worship to the Nymphs, to Pan, and to the God of Love, and finding no food more delicious than the fruits of autumn, and the milk of their flocks."
"The study, at the University of Florida, Penn State University, and other colleges, noted that Americans — especially at this time when people resolve to lose weight in the New Year — spend countless hours and billions and billions of dollars on health clubs, exercise equipment, and potions aimed at improving our physiques."
"Beautiful and pale as the fabulous Naiad in the last agony of separation from her lover, she was seated so as to rest with her back against a part of the ruined wall, while her mantle, dripping with the water which her protector had used profusely to recall her senses, clung to her slender and beautifully proportioned form."
"Besides easing aches and pains, Adams says the pleasant aroma of the California sagebrush helps people relax. He says a plant called Spanish Bayonet was used by American Indians for food. Its leaves and roots produce a kind of soap, and the fiber from the stems can be used as a poultice for wounds, and for making clothing."
"Surprisingly, the number seven is consistently considered lucky, even for very different cultures. Everyone knows that in western casinos, a person wins at the slot machines if they get triple sevens, and seven is the most probable outcome of rolling two dice. But even the ancient Greeks thought seven was a special number."
"Sailors from Polynesia first settled the Hawaiian Islands around the year 400. For more than 1,000 years, the Native Hawaiians lived together in small groups, farmed and fished for their needs, and governed themselves. In the late 1700s, one native leader overpowered the others and united the islands into a single kingdom."
"She hadn’t forgotten the fun she had playing on the beach in Florida, and while this beach was different—it didn’t have any of the pretty shells or funny little crawdads she had found on the Florida beach—still it had lovely white sand and dainty little waves and was quite the nicest place for play that Mary Jane had seen."
"Zelda, I'm going away for a month. ""A month?"" ""A month."" ""A whole month?"" ""A whole month."" ""Really?"" ""Yes."" ""A whole month?"" ""Don't you understand what a month means?"" ""No."" ""A month is four weeks."" ""One?"" ""Four!"" ""Two?"" ""Four!"" ""Come on, father, let's go!"" ""Zelda, I said I'm going by myself."" ""What about me?"" ""Stay here!"""
"Plants can react to sounds. University of Missouri chemical ecologists Heidi Appel and Jack Schultz recorded the subtle chewing noises of a caterpillar eating a plant. Being eaten stimulated the plant’s defenses. But when the sounds were played to another plant that was not being eaten, they triggered a defensive response."
Scientists from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory report they were able to create a type of fusion reaction by bombarding a microscopic pellet of fuel with beams from 192 powerful lasers to compress its component parts — hydrogen isotopes known as deuterium and tritium — and fuse them together at the atomic level.
"President Joe Biden’s plan announced Wednesday to plow $2 trillion into an eight-year overhaul of U.S. infrastructure was met with only limited carping from many voices normally critical of government spending. Meanwhile, economists expressed broad agreement that the plan, as proposed, would power long-run economic growth."
"Several solar facilities in the region generate electricity on an industrial scale and others are under construction. Under Colorado law, 30 percent of power used in the state must be generated from renewable sources by 2020. But given the demand for electricity, Alamosa County's year-round sunshine still won't be enough."
"The researchers say on Earth, phosphine is only made industrially or by microbes that thrive in oxygen-free environments. The international team, which includes researchers from Britain, the U.S. and Japan, published their findings in two papers — the science journal Nature on Monday, and Astrobiology journal on Saturday."
"Millions of coral larvae are then placed back onto damaged areas of the reef that may not otherwise regenerate naturally. The larvae are put into large enclosures where their growth can be monitored. Early results are encouraging. It is estimated that 100 juvenile coral have survived, and are settling into their new home."
"A chandelier shaped like a basketball net, by American artist David Hammons, a slow-burning wax replica of a 16th century sculpture aimed to melt completely in six months, the works of Chinese-born painter Xinyi Cheng and British artist Lynette Yiadom-Boakye — the Pinault Collection is an eclectic mix of contemporary art."
"Pop music in the 1980's relied heavily on electronic synthesizers to create music and digitally mimic acoustic instruments. The instruments' sounds were all copied from recordings and later manipulated by the synthesizer. A little computing power can affect the pitch, the duration of a note and in some cases, its quality."
"David Galvin says the greening of Kokomo is not some kooky futuristic experiment. He sees thousands of new jobs in its future—assembling solar panels, making parts for algae ponds, and so forth. Kokomo has a skilled workforce and plenty of factory space, he says. And the auto crisis has provided the motivation for change."
"An Olympic boxing champion buys a very expensive jacket. He comes to the Olympic village and leaves his jacket in a dressing room with a sign saying ""You take the jacket, I kill you. Olympic boxing champion."" In an hour he comes back to see his jacket gone, and another sign: ""You catch me first. Olympic running champion."""
"The wave of claims by the newly unemployed has overwhelmed some state agencies that handle the paperwork, with the jobless workers forced to wait hours in line at offices or online if they were filing electronically. Jobless claim websites in some states, including New York and Oregon, have crashed in the wave of claims."
"It is not undeservedly that the Pyrenean guides have acquired the reputation they enjoy for intelligence and civility; and Charlet, of the Hôtel de France, is certainly a most favourable specimen: frugal in his habits, modest in his demeanour, and of great activity of body, he forms the beau ideal of a mountain cicerone."
"Two scientists in Scotland have developed a pocket-sized device to check whether whiskey is fake, using equipment originally developed to examine blood samples. They hope the techniques won’t just help the whisky industry clamp down on fakes which cost it hundreds of millions of dollars a year — but will also save lives."
"Last year, Seed Savers Exchange donated two hundred seventy-one heirloom seed varieties to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, far above Norway. The vault opened in February of two thousand eight. Since then, the exchange has stored one thousand six hundred sixty open-pollinated heirloom seed varieties in the storage center."
"The slogan ""Arbeit macht frei"" at the gates of the Nazi concentration camps was entirely cynical. The prisoners who believed the deceitful promise that work would set them free had no real chance of freedom, regardless of how much they laboured. Many of them were worked to death; many more were deliberately exterminated."
"Upstairs the Swede was closing his bag. His back was half-turned toward the door, and hearing a noise there, he turned and jumped up, uttering a loud cry. Scully’s face was frightening in the light of the small lamp he carried. This yellow shine, streaming upward, left his eyes in deep shadows. He looked like a murderer."
"Double Indemnity is the title of a classic 1944 film noir, in which a philandering insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray) and a housewife (Barbara Stanwyck) plot to murder her husband, but to make it look like an accident, in order to collect on an insurance policy that will pay double the value in case of accidental death."
"While Google has been coy about the type of robots it’s looking to develop, one possibility would be something that could deliver goods to consumers’ doors, like Amazon’s drones. Instead of through the air, however, Google would make the deliveries via self-driving cars, something the company has already been working on."
"By this time, a lot of Poplar Island had dropped into the bay. The erosion formed a small island that was named Jefferson Island. A clubhouse was built there. During the nineteen thirties it became a favorite weekend place for Democratic Party politicians and businessmen. The clubhouse burned down in nineteen forty-six."
"But, Maitland writes, not all of the news is bad. Over the past ten years, she says, there's been an increase in funding for malaria control efforts, such as the distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets and the widespread introduction of artemisinin combination therapies, the most effective treatments at the moment."
"We assess with high confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election, the consistent goals of which were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency."
"The many birds that choose Bolinas as their winter home would have a feast if these butterflies were edible, but Monarchs are protected by an acrid secretion which is distasteful to birds, and enjoy a long life on this account, living not only all winter, but long enough to taste the sweetness of the spring wildflowers."
"In front of the camp were the fords of the Boyne deep and dangerous, protected by rugged banks, and defended by some breast-works; while the huts and hedges were lined with infantry on the rere; and at some distance arose the church and village of Donore, upon whose commanding heights King James in person was stationed."
"Love is like some fresh spring, that leaves its cresses, its gravel bed and flowers to become first a stream and then a river, changing its aspect and its nature as it flows to plunge itself in some boundless ocean, where restricted natures only find monotony, but where great souls are engulfed in endless contemplation."
"Centenarians, people who live to be 100 years old, are currently the fastest growing age group in the World. And the U.S. has more than any other country, well over 50,000. Living longer may be more common than it was, but living well and continuing a healthy, active lifestyle into the second century can be a challenge."
"Ding Liren is the new World Chess Champion. In the tiebreaker, the first three games ended in a draw, and the fourth, with Ding leading the black pieces in a Spanish opening, was sensationally won by the Chinese Dragon, who thus overcame the Russian Bear, Ian Nepomniachtchi. The top of the chess universe has a new face."
"New York City has kicked off a year-long celebration to mark the 150th anniversary of Central Park, which was created from barren swampland in the heart of the city. It is considered the ultimate everyman's playground. The city will honor the park's sesquicentennial with a host of concerts, fireworks and special events."
"Five years ago the maverick, anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle, brain-child of the chaotic and shaggy-bearded stand-up comic Beppe Grillo, exploded on the Italian electoral scene, grabbing sufficient seats to force Italy’s established parties to form a ‘grand coalition’ government to shut out the political upstarts."
"The vibrations the tiny lever produces are also incredibly small, oscillating at approximately one millionth of a millimeter. So to measure these microscopic vibrations, a laser is projected onto the lever and the light that’s reflected back is converted into an electrical signal that is then interpreted by a clinician."
"Sonepheth Sombat, a slender, muscular, amiable young man with a dark crew cut, is a police corporal on the security detail of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in the center of Washington, D.C. Billions of dollars worth of currency are produced here each year, as well as postage stamps and various security documents."
"The house itself, constructed chiefly of a framework of massive timber, filled in with stone or brick, had no pretensions to architectural beauty, albeit its wide, projecting eaves, its large chimneys, and latticed windows, with its neat, well-kept garden full of gay flowers, gave it a picturesque and quaint appearance."
"On these blustery, end-of-winter days in New York City, the sky is often grey and overcast, the wind may howl, and there is nary a green leaf to be seen. But in the tropical garden at the Butterfly Conservatory, it is a humid thirty-two degrees Celsius and the air is alive with the iridescent flutter of patterned wings."
"According to the IAU, a ""dwarf planet"" is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, (c) has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit, and (d) is not a satellite."
"All living cells undergo cell division and palbociclib's unique capacity to halt the cell division process (also known as the 'cell cycle') therefore has potentially broad applicability, said lead author Amy S. Clark, MD, MSCE, an assistant professor of Hematology/Oncology at Penn's Perelman School of Medicine and ACC."
"U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin painted a bleak picture Tuesday of the economic devastation the coronavirus pandemic has wrought on the country, but they held out hope that a raft of loans and assistance to families and businesses would provide relief in the coming months."
"God’s blessing on all nations, who long and work for that bright day, when o’er earth’s habitations no war, no strife shall hold its sway; who long to see that all men free no more shall foes, but neighbours be, who long to see that all men free no more shall foes, but neighbours, no more shall foes, but neighbours be."
"Knowing how ingeniously Mr. Shei had laid his plans and guarded against every imaginable emergency, he had not been altogether certain that his artful contrivance would succeed, but the scientist’s acute distress was ample proof that Mr. Shei had been outmaneuvered and that The Gray Phantom was master of the situation."
"For some half-hour he tried to comfort himself with an idea that he could get hold of Captain Marrable and maul him; that it would be a thing permissible for him, a magistrate, to go forth with a whip and flog the man, and then perhaps shoot him, because the man had been fortunate in love where he had been unfortunate."
"A chemical analysis of 400 popular lipstick brands, conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, has found that all the lipsticks contained lead, a toxic metal linked to severe health problems. The agency says the lead levels are so low that the products are safe, but health groups insist there is no safe level."
"Biofuels are gaining credibility as a supplement to petroleum fuel in some developed as well as developing countries. Biofuels are made from plant waste, including sugarcane and cassava. But some say prospects of using biofuel in large quantities in Nigeria is limited by some constraints regarding resources and costs."
"The pachyderms took part in the King’s Cup Elephant Polo Tournament. Fifty-one of the competitors were teenage females. Each weighed about three tons. They carried a player, who gives directions, and a mahout, who helps to guide the animal. The owners of the elephants lent them to corporations which finance the teams."
"Most American politicians learned how to debate when they were students in school. Class debates are common in American schools, offering students an opportunity to marshal their arguments and defend their point of view. Iuliia Iarmolenko visited a school in Washington, D.C. to see how children like the art of debate."
"Construction on the Hall of Ocean Life began in 1922 and it finally opened to the public in May 1933. Ms. Stiassny says the original hall reflected the 19th century concept that nature served man, focusing on the whaling industry, and activities like pearl-diving. A diorama depicting Pacific pearl divers still stands."
"In the late afternoon, at the conclusion of the race-meet, Bosnian society repairs en masse to the beautiful and fashionable Villa Bosna, where, in the cool of the evening, in the casino or under the great trees, it sups and dines and chatters, until it is time for the last of the evening trains to leave for Sarajevo."
"While I was exploring D.C., I decided to walk through Pershing Park, and came upon this plaza by happenstance. On the ground there are quotes from American luminaries about D.C., along with a giant stone map of the Capital. You may not be able to step inside of the real White House, but you can step on top of it here!"
"One mechanism involves disarming a biological process known as autophagy. Under normal circumstances, autophagy allows cells to sweep away debris, including viruses; but, by suppressing this function, HIV is able to keep on infecting white blood cells, eventually leading to a breakdown of the protective immune system."
"Ruth said, ""Don't urge me to leave you, and to return from following you, for where you go, I will go; and where you stay, I will stay. Your people will be my people, and your God my God. Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May God do so to me, and more also, if anything but death parts you and me."""
"Optic scanners, which cost about $100,000, are the most technologically-advanced part of the process. They are programmed to identify certain types of objects, like plastic water and milk bottles. When the scanner “sees” one, it signals dozens of air fountains on the conveyor belt, to blow it onto a separate conveyor."
"Finally, Maitland worries about the problems with emerging drug resistance, both to the insecticides that are used to treat bed nets, to guard against biting mosquitoes at night, and to the most effective tool in the medical arsenal, artemisinin-based compounds. Resistance to the drug has begun to show up in Cambodia."
"A British regulatory agency is urging consumers to avoid burnt or very well toasted bread and deeply browned potatoes. Instead, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) says people should ""Go for the Gold"" when it comes to starch-containing foods, cooking them to a golden brown, enough to retain the desirable taste and crunch."
The hair on the instep of the foot of the stepfather of Father Pedro's mason is black. Whoever says the hair of the inset of the foot of the stepfather of Father Pedro's mason isn't black has blacker hair on the instep of the foot than the black hair of the instep of the foot of the stepfather of Father Pedro's mason.
"When the house is renovated and refurnished, all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves, there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton."
"So-called hormone replacement therapy, or HRT, is currently the only regulatory-approved treatment for menopause symptoms. But researcher Katherine Newton of Group Health in Seattle, Washington notes fewer women are opting to take HRT. So, researchers are looking for healthy alternatives to ease menopause complaints."
"The match for the 2020 FIDE World Championship, postponed because of the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), will now be held from November 26th to December 16th, 2021, alongside the World Expo in Dubai, UAE, between current world champion Magnus Carlsen and GM Ian Nepomniachtchi, who won the 2020 Candidates Tournament."
"Scientists at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and the Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands engineered a more virulent strain of the H5N1 bird flu to try to understand how mutations could make it more infectious to both animal and human populations — a change that could lead to a global pandemic."
"Forasmuch as you have desired so simple a woman to write in so worthy a book, good Master Lieutenant, therefore I shall, as a friend, desire you, and as a Christian, require you, to call upon God to incline your heart to his laws, to quicken you in his way, and not to take the word of truth utterly out of your mouth."
"The process of stem cell activation is the same as seen in embryos to stimulate organ growth, according to gerontology professor Valter Longo, the director of USC's Longevity Institute and senior author of both studies. He said the fasting-mimicking diet can be used to reprogram cells without any genetic alterations."
"Kartik Chandran, a professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, New York, helped identify the antibodies, which were described online in the journal Cell. He is optimistic that the antibodies can be used as a single therapy to treat all Ebola viruses."
"I think that because the world demographics foretell a shifting to a much older population, it may help foster a global trend towards sustainability instead of expansionism. Such an outlook may affect phenomena like space colonization. If the population gets too old, would people still be motivated to colonize space?"
"When the day dawned and the cloudlets clustered red about the rising sun, the warm rays would fall upon her giving to her some hue of life, and Pygmalion's heart would beat high with the hope that a miracle had been wrought, and that his love at last had kindled a soul akin to his own in the marble statue before him."
"Now came, preceded by lictors with their fasces, the vestal virgins, seated in silver chariots drawn by milk-white steeds, followed closely by another band of flamens, leading a long line of hostia (oxen to be sacrificed), their horns richly gilded, their heads adorned with wreaths, each animal led by a victimarius."
"The African continent has the world’s lowest rates of electrification, a fact that caught the attention of U.S. President Barack Obama when he visited the continent last year. So he announced an ambitious plan to electrify 20 million households in six countries: Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria and Tanzania."
"How do you interact with members of your community if they're stretched across the world? Many people rely on the Internet, email and social media to communicate across borders. But for many Hmong people — far from their ancestral home in Asia — teleconferencing is the most popular way to share news and information."
"Pete White works with Captain White’s Seafood City in Washington, D.C. The family-owned business gathers crabs and other seafood from the bay and sells it at its store right along the Potomac River. White told VOA that his family has been in the business for about 100 years. He is a big fan of Chesapeake blue crabs."
"During the reigns of Kings Louis XV and Louis XVI, France supported the English colonists in their resistance against the London government not because of an admiration for democracy but because the French wanted to weaken the British, who, for a long period of time, had been the enemies of the Government of France."
"Fellow citizens, Lincoln said. ""We meet this evening not in sorrow, but in gladness of heart. The surrender of the main army of the Confederacy gives hope of a righteous and speedy peace. The joy cannot be held back. By these recent successes, we have had pressed more closely upon us the question of reconstruction."""
"In 1964, Senator Barry Goldwater won the Republican presidential nomination even though questions were raised about his having been born in Arizona when it was still a territory and not a state. The question never gained much traction and was made moot when President Lyndon Johnson defeated Goldwater in a landslide."
"Oxygen was later produced and introduced into our atmosphere through two processes; photochemical dissociation, caused by the breakup of water molecules by the sun’s ultraviolet light, and photosynthesis, the process that uses carbon dioxide and water (H₂O) to form organic compounds while also releasing oxygen (O₂)."
"The authors pointed to studies that have shown the benefits of social interactions in health care. For example, in one investigation, patients who talked on the phone weekly with a peer saw a more significant drop in a marker of diabetes, called glycated hemoglobin levels, than those who worked only with clinicians."
"While a lot of details remain to be negotiated, the basic idea behind the agreement is that companies should be required to pay at least some taxes on profits in the countries where their products and services are consumed, rather than allocating all of their profits to entities headquartered in tax haven countries."
"Her purr was already the loudest I have heard from any cat, but she fancied she could improve her mewing; and she mewed in the garden, she mewed in the house, she mewed at meals, she mewed at prayers, she mewed when she was hungry to show that she wanted food, and she mewed when she had had it to show her gratitude."
"RushmoreDrive.Com President and CEO Johnny Taylor is pleased with the feedback he's gotten since the website's launch early this year. Still, some critics balk at the idea of a race-based search engine. Isn't that ""discrimination,"" they ask? Taylor's response: diversity is a cornerstone of the American marketplace."
"Although Mr. Koizumi's musings about retirement are receiving attention from the international news media, there has been little mention of them domestically. Political analysts say the public and most Japanese reporters already expect the prime minister to leave office when his current term ends in September 2006."
"Coral reefs are essential for coastal protection, and for the food security and economic wellbeing of millions of people around the world. They are an important source of protein, a potential source of pharmaceuticals, and as Lauretta Burke of the World Resources Institute points out, a valuable tourist attraction."
"The whale is surrounded with a dizzying collection of similarly updated material, 750 sea creature models, high-definition video projections, interactive computer stations, and 14 renovated life-size dioramas, including elephant seals on Mexico's Guadalupe Island, an Arctic polar bear, and a dolphin feeding frenzy."
"Damage from Hurricane Rita to the many U.S. oil refineries along the Texas Gulf coast appears limited, and analysts say the long-term economic impact of the storm should be minimal. They say any increase in domestic U.S. gasoline prices should be temporary as refineries shut down by the hurricane resume operations."
"A group of visitors, wearing fire-engine red helmets, takes an elevator deep underground. From there, the group follows project leader Peter Jenni up creaky stairs to dizzying heights. Engineers and technicians are installing a massive detector, about the height of a six-story building. Jenni explains how it works."
The energy crisis buffeting the continent has placed Johnson and other European leaders in the difficult position of decrying fossil fuels while urgently prioritizing affordable access to them to avoid a political backlash by voters and businesses furious at the spiking costs of heating homes and running factories.

"Researchers at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, modified vancomycin, invented 60 years ago and considered a last-resort treatment against many of these infections. They made a key change to its molecular structure, interfering with how the bacterium, enterococcus, makes protective cell walls."
"Parker Solar Probe has been designed to withstand the extreme conditions and temperature fluctuations for the mission. The key lies in its custom heat shield and an autonomous system that helps protect the mission from the Sun’s intense light emission, but does allow the coronal material to “touch” the spacecraft."
"Mike Williams has spent much of his life on the Kuskokwim River in the western region of sub-arctic Alaska. He says rising temperatures during the last decade have been melting the permafrost layer of Earth, causing increased erosion. Bethel, Alaska and other towns have had to constantly reinforce their sea walls."
"Saxena, along with his team of Ian Lenz and Mevlana Gemici, tested the programming using a commercially available quadrotor flying machine, which is about the size of a small table and has four helicopter rotors. The first step, Saxena said, was to program the quadrotor to navigate through hallways and stairwells."
"A devalued currency makes Chinese exports cheaper and more affordable to consumers worldwide, while boosting the price of U.S. exports to China. For decades, the United States has consumed more foreign goods than it exports, incurring massive trade deficits. One of America's largest trade imbalances is with China."
"Ebola got its name from the first documented outbreak, which occurred along the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly Zaire, in 1976. Since then, there have been two dozen outbreaks of Ebola in Africa, including a current one that has infected nine people in the DRC. Three people have died."
"The study included men from the United States, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Greece and Australia. The researchers identified 63 alterations in the human genome that increase the risk of premature baldness. And in many instances, the DNA regions overlapped with genes for short stature."
"The International Comparison Program evaluates economies based on purchasing power parity, or PPP, which estimates how much money can buy in different countries. Some economists say the method helps more accurately determine a country's relative economic output, since comparisons are complicated by exchange rates."
"The family also spent time in Bali, Borneo, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Nepal. They backpacked, snorkeled, and got a close up view of animals few American children see except in zoos, but they saw disturbing evidence as well of how human activities can affect the environment. Zoe Glick read an excerpt from her journal."
"NASA says the current solar arrays are functioning well but were designed for a 15-year service life and are in their 21st year of service. The new solar arrays will be positioned in front of six of the current arrays, increasing the station’s total available power from 160 kilowatts to a maximum of 215 kilowatts."
"A frosty east-west relationship led to a sort of brinkmanship where both NATO and Russia flew military aircraft close to the other side's frontiers or even deliberately made brief incursions into the other side's airspace, either to test air defence capabilities or as part of a pattern of intimidation or coercion."
"Stanford University electrical engineering professor Shanhui Fan said the panels—which include a layer of material similar to what is found in sand—act like a kind of high-tech mirror, both siphoning heat out of the buildings and reflecting the sun's rays, sending both 100 kilometers up into the coldness of space."
"By contrast, the number of renters between the ages of 35 and 59 grew just 17 percent during the same time period, and the number of renters under the age of 34 increased 7 percent, according to apartment search website RENTCafe, which conducted the analysis focusing on cities with populations of at least 100,000."

Direct investment rose nine percent last year to $15.8 billion, as Vietnamese media project more growth this year. Foreign firms, including Intel and Samsung Electronics, have sited Vietnam for its cheap labor and land."
"Countries around the world are preparing for a global outbreak of avian flu. Steven Riley, from the University of Hong Kong, says researchers are developing and stockpiling vaccines. The thinking behind this is that a very small mutation will eventually transform this avian strain into one that can infect humans."
"A very difficult endgame – white rook, knight, and three pawns (Carlsen) against the black queen and a pawn (Nepomniachtchi) – was won yesterday after 136 moves and almost eight hours of play. The engines said it was a theoretical draw but the brilliant Norwegian managed to conquer the victory. A historical game!"
"Tardo and Peo were entertained royally at luncheon by Saranta, their host, who appeared to be the wealthy overlord of this portion of the planet. The meal was delicious—tender, inch-thick steaks served with delicate wine sauce and half a dozen of the planet's exotic vegetables, topped off by a cool fruit dessert."
"Studies in middle- and high-income countries show nearly 50 percent of teenagers and young adults aged 12 to 35 years are exposed to unsafe levels of sound from personal audio devices, and around 40 percent are exposed to potentially damaging levels of sound at concerts, nightclubs and other entertainment venues."

This is the result of a report released by investment bank Merrill Lynch and consulting firm Capgemini."
"In Asia, Europe and the United States, more and more food stuffs are being turned into fuel — more corn and grains into ethanol, more palm oil and other plant materials into biodiesel. Scientists around the world are stepping up research aimed at turning grains, grasses and agricultural waste products into fuels."
"Blue was a rare, expensive color in ancient times, whether it was derived from lapis lazuli mined in Afghanistan some 6,000 years ago, made by blending copper with other elements throughout the Middle East and in ancient China, or mixing an extract of the indigo plant with clay and resin by Mayans in Mesoamerica."
"Iceland is often called the land of ice and fire. It has plenty of ice and glaciers, but is also a geothermal hotspot of bubbling hot water cauldrons, geysers and volcanos. Harnessing all that energy is something Icelanders have been doing for generations, but they're about to take that concept one step further."
"The Biden administration announced Monday that it would waive tariffs on solar panels imported to the United States from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam for 24 months, reducing uncertainty for the U.S. solar energy companies that had been spooked by a Commerce Department investigation launched in March."
"The handling and consumption of bushmeat — meat from wild, non-domesticated animals — is a common occurrence in Africa, particularly in the Congo Basin. It's believed meat from an ape infected by the Ebola virus first passed the deadly disease to humans in 1976. There have been more than 20 outbreaks since then."
"The river's width, depth and swift current made it unwise to try and float wagons across on individual rafts, and unless crossed in the dead of winter when the river was frozen solid, it was safer to transport the wagons and teams across the river on the small steam ferries operated by opportunistic businessmen."
"The supermarket of the past is racing toward a high tech future. And clever marketers are starting with their youngest consumers.
