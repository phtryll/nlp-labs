    "There were no datasets online (that we found at least) that had timestamps, and many datasets did not have sentence level gold translations, so it was difficult to create proper examples. For example, we tried loading a English-Spanish dataset from TED talks, but the translations were only at the talk level, not sentence level. We tried segmenting the talks into sentences and then aligning them, but it was a failure. Although we do not understand Croatian, we have the correct setup to compute COMET scores later on, that we can interpret. Furthermore, the great advantage of this dataset is that the pairs are aligned at the talk level so constructing context windows is straightforward. Choosing 100 examples was a trade-off between having enough examples to compute meaningful COMET scores later on, and the time for one Ollama call. Since for each example we are trying many configurations, this can take a while. For that reason, we set up Ollama to run on GPU, considerably speeding up inference time."
